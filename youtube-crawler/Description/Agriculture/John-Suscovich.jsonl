She doesn't always agree with your plans and that is going to affect your business. If the birds are cold and it's miserable out they are not going to grow as well and you're going to have slightly slimmer margins as a result.\n\nI do a couple things to combat this. I make sure the birds are properly hardened off before putting them out, I won't put them out in a thunderstorm, and I make adjustments to their shelters when I know the weather is going to be bad.\n\nIn general the birds don't gain as well in the Spring with it being colder. In the middle of the summer they grow really well with warmer temps. Le sigh.\n\nGot broiler questions?

Keep in mind that your feeders and waterers take up space too so make sure it's not too crowded in there.\n\nIn the beginning when the chicks are brand new and really small I give them about half of the total space. This is only for the first 2 days. This allows the chicks to get used to the brooder, not get lost in a corner somewhere and get cold, and keeps them a little warmer if it's chilly outside early in the season. After day 2 I open the brooder to the full space and they do fine.\n\nThe most important activity you can do on farm and especially in the brooder is observation. Taking a little time to sit and watch your plants or animals and see how they are behaving will give you a better understanding as to whether they are happy in their environment.\n\nhttp://farmmarketingsolutions.com"}

There is always room to grow as a farmer and always a new skill to try and figure out. Composting has been relatively easy once I had the raw ingredients.\n\nI knew I had to learn it so I learned it. I took action. That's the message of today's video. We're not here to sustain and be sustainable, our goal should be to be regenerative. To take action that adds value back into the earth and works to rebuild soils, forests, pastures, and waterways. If we're sustaining then we're just maintaining. Let's take it one step further.\n\nIt's great that I feel that strongly about just stirring a pile of poo but I really do believe in what I do. Sure it's a lot of work, but the lifestyle is rewarding in ways I never dreamed of. I'm looking forward to spreading this compost in my gardens and in my hop yard this year. With everything I learn and everything I do I get one step closer to achieving my goal of making the world a better place.\n\nJoin me in that goal. We'll have a lot of fun doing it. There will be ups and downs, but at the end of the day wee can reflect, have a drink, and know that today we tried.\n\nHere's a link for too much information on composting:\nhttp://articles.extension.org/pages/18567/making-and-using-compost-for-organic-farming\n\nHere's the thermometer I'm using:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/REOTEMP-FG20P-Backyard-Compost-Thermometer/dp/B002P5RGMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463654493&sr=8-1&keywords=reotemp+compost+thermometer\n\nHere's me and Scott:\nhttp://farmmarketingsolutions.com"}
