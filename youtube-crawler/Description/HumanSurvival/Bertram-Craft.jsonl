Internationally refer \"puukko\" to a specific style of traditional Scandinavian style belt knifes. It's often internationally referred to as a \"puukko knife\" and not just \"puukko\" even though you can argue that \"puukko knife\" means if translated \"knife knife\". Adding \"knife\" just make sure that people internationally don't need to translate the Finnish word \"puukko\" before understanding it's a knife. \n\n2. Do you sell?\nNo. Don't sell anything. \n\n----------------------------------------\n\nHere can you see how I made the outdoor blacksmith shop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWgESobxudc&t=86s\n\n_________________\n\nLocation: Denmark - my property. \n\n_________________\n\nVideo gear: Nikon D7000, Nikon 50 1.8, R\u00f8de videomacro, iMovie.  \n\n_________________"}

Clean and remote classic northern wilderness. Fresh water rivers. Pine, spruce and birch forrest. Mountains, bears, wolves, eagles, reindeers etc. No wildlife is giving campers problems. I can't give you any information about my location, only that I am somewhere in Sapmi. You need to be the owner or get the owners permission if you want to do the same.   \n\n_________________\n\nConsuming: Water, berries and fish (cranberry, blueberry, smoked and air dried perch).\n\n_________________\n\nA few questions: \n\n1. Is the blacksmithing tools homemade? \nYes - video on the channel about how I make tongs and how I made the anvil and the hammer. No video yet on how I make bellows, but it is a future video. If you want similar do I recommend you make it your self - but it is also an option to find secondhand or pay for custom work (I don't sell anything). Example can similar anvil be found online if you google \"stake anvil\" or \"stump anvil\" or \"viking anvil\" or similar.  \n\n2. Can you give a few points about the blacksmith shop set up?\nYes. The stones closest to the fire will need replacements once in a while. The branch used as rope on the anvil stump helps prevent it wood from spritting. Used a tree as a stump because it was convenient - the tree was located just right and dying (small trees so close to big tress always struggle). The wooden pegs keeps the bellows from moving and is easy to remove and use agin or replace. The goal is to keep the fire narrow so the air you blow don't need to travel far and the sides open so the forge fit long work pieces - but before you start forging can you move around the stones to custom fit the task. Make sure the bellows don't touch the fire, you don't wan't to heat up the steel tubes. Try to make it a habit always to use both bellows. Let one blow air and one suck air at the same time. The constant blow of air makes it harder for the other tube to suck in hot air and burn or dry the leather. Ideally does only the valve take in air and not the tube. Constant blow of air also just makes the forge more efficient.\n\n3. Is the water safe to drink? \nYes. Almost all water in Sapmi can you drink straight from the source. Especially all on remote locations. It comes from the near by mountains - rain or snow/ice melting. \n\n4. What fish did you catch?\nTrout. \n\n5. Why use a stick and not a paddle for the raft?\nA stick from the tipi was the easy solution and more ideal for pushing agains the bottom of the river... In the areas where the river is too deep will a paddle work beter - but just using a stick isn't too bad.\n\n6. How did you dry the fish?\nHung them up in the tipi as raw with nothing added, no salt or anything (show it in part 1) and left them where for about two weeks. Whenever I visit the camp did I light a fire inside the tipi for adding some smoke taste and soften the bones - but most of the time was I not in the camp and the fish did just dry in the air. The air in Sapmi is in general dry and it makes air drying meat really easy. \n\n7. Was it \"chaga\" you used to carry fire?\nYes. A fungus called \"Chaga\". I use it in other videos for making tea. In this case do I use it for transporting fire.The chaga was collected near by the tipi and was only dried a few hours next to the campfire. If you want to transport fire like this do I recommend bringing along a few spare pieces so you can replace it doing the travel. One piece lasted in this case about 30 minutes. If it starts glowing too much can you just scrape some of the glowing part away.  \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used:\n1. Pants = Klattermusen Gere 2.0 Regular\n2.

Why make the fire place so big?\nI will mainly be using this shelter doing winter and need a big fire so it can burn most of the night giving me a more comfortable sleep. It also offers \"table\" place. A low wall of stones is added and it will block some wind and reflect some more heat towards the shelter. Ideally would the wall be a lot taller, but choose not to as a compromise so the viewers still are able to see the fire from most of the camera angles. \n\n2. Is the wood storage waterproof? \nNo. It is only meant to provide very basic covering from the first few snowfalls - after that will snow create walls and shelter the firewood ideally. Near by is quite a few dead standing pine trees and I will just cut down what I think I need each time I visit the camp until the snow provide ideal shelter for the wood storage.\n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used:\n1.

I did forget the meat at home... never done that before, but it happened this time.\n\nWhat wood did you use for making the spoon?\nOak. \n\nWas it a branch you used for the rack bindings?\nYes - green branch from pine twisted into \"rope\". You can make most wood into \"rope\" like that. \n\nWhy add moss on the table?\nKeeps the sticks better in place and no small side branches can catch what ever you lay on the table or just fall though the tabletop. .\n\nWhy didn't you do a better job on sewing the sack?\nIt's an old one, over 20 years old and the material is not strong any more. I did just quickly, while cooking the food, prevent the big hole from getting bigger. I will replace the stitches when I get home and sew all the holes with nice straight stitches - or maybe just consider if it's time to replace the sack with a new one.\n\nDid you like the billhook?\nYes, it did a fine job and I will use it more in future videos....

Having both an axe and a billhook would be very useful in a camp like this. \n\nIs it a Sami sewing kit?\nYes - homemade. \n\nWhat is that background noise?\nOnly nature sounds - I am about one mile from a big sea and that sounds sometimes similar to a highway.

How did you make the tinder?\nBy boiling the \"amadou\" layer from the \"tinder fungus\" in about 50/50% wood ashes and water for about 1 hour. Amadou is a layer next to the outside hard shell on the fungus. All hard wood ashes can be used, but birch ashes should be some of the most ideal. You can cut off the amadou or you can, like I do in the video, make the fungus softer by boiling and separate it by hitting and or pulling. You can use green or dry tinder fungus - just try to avoid the rotten once (the one I use in the video is close to be to rotten). I can't tell you why it works - but it makes the amadou a hundred times easier to use for fire lightning. In my area of the word have tinder fungus been used as the main tinder long before the viking age and way after the vikings. The tinder I made in the video will be enough for lighting a few hundred campfires. \"Tinder fungus\" is a specific fungus growing on hardwood trees and very common in my part of the world. other names for the fungus is \"Horse's Hoof Fungus\", \"Fomes fomentarius\" and \"Hoof Fungus\".  \n\n2. Is the water safe to drink? \nYes. Almost all water in Sapmi can you drink straight from the source. All from remote locations.

Making a chair with out using cord and trying an axe I made a few days ago in my blacksmith shop. I am also enjoying some great food and the comfort from wood stove and canvas tent. This is the long version of the video - here is the short version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR3jlITIYzY\n\n----------------------\n\nLocation: Denmark - previous viking country. West coast of Jutland - sand, big sea, spruce and pine forrest. Some of the most remote in Denmark, but a lot of people in Denmark so limited how remote it can get. A lot of birds and deer. No bears only a few wolves - nothing dangerous for campers. If you want to do the same in Denmark do you need to be the owner or get the owners permission.\n\n----------------------\n\nConsuming: Water, Juniperus communis tea. Bacon and onions. Cow, beans, onions, tomatoes, oregano, salt. \n\n----------------------\n\nHere can you see how I made the saw frame https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl-_n2yM8c0&t=93s\n\nHere can you see how I made the Yakut knife https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGc_mdGBoHY\n\n---------------------\n\nA few questions:\n\nWhat is the temperature?\nJust above freezing. \n \nWhat kind of axe are you using?\nHomemade. I did just copy an old axe design I have seen in Scandinavia. I don't sell anything. \n\nWhat is that background noise?\nOnly nature sounds - I am about one mile from a big sea and that sounds sometimes similar to a highway. The rest is just wind. \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used in the video:\n1. Sweater = unknown. \n2. Pot = made by \"eagle\" 10 liters. \n3. Pants = made by \"Klattermusen\"\n4.
