U.S. Marine and U.S. Army mortar teams conduct live-fire exercises with the M327, M1129 Mortar Carrier, Soltam K6 Mortars.\n\nMortier 120mm Ray\u00e9 Tract\u00e9 Mod\u00e8le F1 or M327 - in service with the U.S. Marine Corps as the M327 120mm Expeditionary Fire Support System is a heavy mortar of French origin. It was designed by Thomson-Brandt as the successor to the MO-120 AM-50. The RT in the designator stands for ray\u00e9, tract\u00e9, which means rifled, towed.\n\nThe Soltam K6 is a 120 mm mortar that was developed by Soltam Systems of Israel. It is the long-range version of the Soltam K5 and has replaced older systems, such as the 107-millimetre (4.2 in) M30, in several armies including the United States Army. It is much lighter than the M30, has a greater range, and can sustain a rate of fire of four rounds per minute, while the M30 could sustain only three.\n\nThe M1129 Mortar Carrier, is an 8\u00d78 wheeled armored mortar carrier of the Stryker family of combat vehicles produced by General Dynamics Land Systems. It is in use with the United States Army.\n\nThe M106A3 mortar carrier is self-propelled artillery vehicle in service with the United States Army.\n\nVideo Credits: U.S. Army & U.S. Marine Corps  |  United States Department of Defense\n\nThumbnail Credit: U.S. Army photo by Gertrud Zach\n\n\u25baSubscribe Now  -- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4layPPCzgR_99g5VYYvmQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u25baKnow a second language?

Maritime prepositioning enables deployment flexibility and an increased capability to respond rapidly to a crisis or contingency with a credible presence. \n\nThe F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the vertical flight system. Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight. Jet thrust is sent directly downwards during vertical flight. \n\nVideo Credits: U.S. Marine Corps Motion Imagery by Cpl. Richard Limone\n\nThumbnail Credit: Sgt.
