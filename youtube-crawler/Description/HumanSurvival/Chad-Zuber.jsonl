Two of the clay pieces are just a test of clay found somewhere else but the third piece is made of clay found by the hut and sculpted like a turtle with five holes to hold cattail torches.

Now that the rains are over I can proceed making adobe bricks which I will use to build the walls of the fireplace that will be adjoined to the hut. I spent a lot of time considering how I would accomplish this. I estimate that I will need about 70 bricks to complete the project. It will take me approximately 18 hours of labor to make all the bricks. Then the actual construction will be the easy part. I chose the location of the fireplace to be in the back of the hut that way the hut can be heated from the rocket stove at the front as well as the fireplace in the back. Breaking through the wall was much more difficult than I imagined. The adobe bricks are very tough.\n\nFollow me on Facebook.com/PrimitiveSurvivalAdventure\nFollow me on Facebook.com/chadzuber\nFollow me on Instagram @zuberchad\n\nCamera: Nikon D7200\nSound: Zoom H4N\nEditing: Final Cut Pro X on MacBook Air\nLocation: southern California, USA\n\nMusic credits: \n\nDrums of the Deep by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400021\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/"}

I'm carrying with me some essential items that I made and a small amount of food to keep me going for several days. On this day I found some very important resources that will be essential for me to inhabit this region. Watch closely as I put to use these basic primitive tools. You may recognize some of them from past videos such as when I made my small clay cooking pot.

I travel alone, shoot, edit, upload, everything, all alone. On a few occasions I may be accompanied by a friend.\n\nHow many cameras do you use?\nUsually I use just one camera. When I have underwater scenes then I also use a GoPro camera. I get different angles by moving the camera around and repeating the action to create a more cinematic viewing experience for the audience.\n\nWhere is this place?\nIn order to protect the integrity of the natural landscape I prefer to be very vague about the locations I use. There are places that I used to visit that were so beautiful and untouched but the consequences of social media brought all kinds of people to visit and sadly some people do not respect nature and have badly damaged these places. Therefore I do not share locations.\n\nWhere did you get your sandals?\nI first started wearing sandals on outdoor adventures in February 2014. I\u2019m so glad that I did because wearing these Luna Sandals has really helped strengthen my feet. You can see their selection of adventure and running sandals at this link: https://www.lunasandals.com/?rfsn=102280.45562&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=102280.45562\n(Note: I receive an affiliate commission from any sales derived from clicking on the link above)\n\nDo you workout?\nYes, I workout, but not in a gym. I have some weights that I use and also do a lot of bodyweight exercises. I also run and sometimes swim. I hike frequently to collect wild foods and to shoot these videos so I'm very active all the time.\n\nAre you vegan or vegetarian?\nI wish I could maintain my health on a primal diet that does not include animals but unfortunately that did not work well and I ended up with health problems as a result of those attempts. From my studies, observations of nature, and personal experience I have come to believe that the best diet for optimal human health is a primal diet (paleo). \n\nDo you get lonely when you\u2019re alone?\nNo, I don\u2019t get lonely. I\u2019m actually so busy shooting video, taking photos and doing so many other things like making cordage, cooking, weaving, etc. that I really don\u2019t have time to think about my lonely condition. Sometimes when something profound happens on an adventure I can\u2019t wait to share it with people, but other than that I do not get lonely.\n\nHow many languages do you speak?\nMy first language is English but I also speak fluent Spanish and Portuguese. I also speak very little Russian. I may soon begin learning more languages.\n\nHow old are you?\nI was born in 1972. At the time of this video I was 48.\n\nWhere did you get the music in your videos?\nThis series is the first one that I am making all the music myself. I recently made a drum and maracas (rumba shaker). I am now using them to create the intro and ending music in my videos, but before in the past I have used royalty free music from several sources including YouTube. Sometimes I bought the music but usually it was free.\n\nMy equipment:\n\nCamera: Nikon D7500\nSound: Zoom H4N\nEditing: Final Cut Pro X on MacBook Air\nLocation: Parts Unknown"}

This raft or kayak proved to be very stable and reliable on the water as I paddled around for about an hour. In this video, I take the same kayak out again but this time I\u2019m bringing my fishing gear to practice some primitive ocean survival fishing techniques with an artificial lure and fresh bait. During this three and a half hour voyage I found myself among a school of dolphin and even had a visit by a sea lion. Once again the kayak performed very well and I am looking forward to even greater adventures at sea in the near future.\n\nPlease subscribe and enable notifications.\n\n** Enable captions in your language\n\nFollow Chad on Facebook.com/chadzuber\nFollow Chad on Instagram @zuberchad\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):\n\nWho films you?  \nI do.

I wasn\u2019t sure that this primitive technique would actually work but I was pleasantly surprised that it did work, and it worked well to create a pillow that not only provides good comfort and neck support but is also a work of art to look at. The combination of different materials truly make it a one-of-a-kind art piece. This video details exactly how you can make your own pillow from 100% natural materials from start to finish and I even include visual diagrams to help explain the process. This technique is my own creation and there are probably better ways to make a similar pillow so please add suggestions in the comments.
