Everyone has watched those shows on TV and have thought about what it would be like to survive in the woods. I like to take it one step further and decided to embark on a solo survival adventure.

In this bushcraft overnight trip I built a raised bed, a nice fire reflector, and established a really nice camp. It rained on and off but fire was no problem. It felt really nice to relax this trip, and was a huge difference to my survival video. Practicing some bushcraft skills was fun, and relaxing by the fire was very enjoyable too. While I shot this video, I happened to see a deer being chased through the woods by what I believe to be a dog. I also came across three deer bones, one of them had a full set of antlers. So I'm not sure what to say about that, or whether it was the dog I saw or cougars in the area. Regardless, I had an awesome time out there on this solo overnight bushcraft camp.

The tree that I picked the young needles from was a douglas fir tree. These new young shoots are high in vitamin C and other minerals, providing an energy boost and quite a nice tasting snack. You could even collect a few for a wild edible spring time salad.
