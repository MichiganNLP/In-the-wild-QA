According to the NPS, it is one of the finest remaining examples of temperate rainforest in the United States and is one of the park's most popular spots to visit. One visitor described walking in the forest as a \"Hansel and Gretel-type of feeling\" while another likened it to a fairy tale enchanted forest.\n\nMost travelers begin at the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center, which is staffed with rangers who can offer advice on what to see and do. The visitor center also houses exhibits and a bookstore. Two short nature trails loop through the forest near the center, the Hall of Mosses Trail (.8 miles) and the Spruce Nature Trail (1.2 miles). If you're up to the challenge, there is also a 17-mile trail that leads to Glacier Meadows, on the shoulder of Mount Olympus, called the Hoh River Trail.\n\nThe Hoh sits on the west side of Olympic National Park, about a two-hour drive from Port Angeles and less than an hour from Forks, Washington. It can be accessed via Upper Hoh Road, off of Highway 101. The visitor center, which is free to access, is open daily during the summer, generally open Friday through Sunday in the spring and fall (hours may vary) and closed December through early March. \n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nMAIN CAMERA: https://amzn.to/389LIr6\nSMALL 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2X2LPOE\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3hPkx8d\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/2Laj8go\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3ngq8FG\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/3hPkN7b\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/2X6quEc\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/38ULxz0\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2MqaXwF\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/3omJHNy \nSD CARD: https://amzn.to/3hBHzPA\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/2KZC2qf\nBACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2Lh8hRk\nGIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2X3k3Bt\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3pL48UR\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/352VNE2\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/389bsUf\nACCESSORIES CASE: https://amzn.to/2X5EopT\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/38RqHjU\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3b1nX67\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3hBzWJ3\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/2X8kjzn\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/3pDs4cG\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/389Nj04\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/390bVaw\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3pWNYYP\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3oennFZ\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3b4WNLB\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/38bupG5\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3pIh5i5\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2X5kOtZ\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3hDI23F\nAUDIO INTERFACE:https://amzn.to/2JHXu2o\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/2MvFYiT\nKEYBOARD: https://amzn.to/38UUMix\nMOUSE: https://amzn.to/350i45x\nHEADPHONE: https://amzn.to/2KZEw83\nSATA DOCKING STATION: https://amzn.to/3ocjtNJ\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/2LhaR9Y\n\nHIKING GEAR:\nBACKPACK: https://amzn.to/3pKHo7k\nBACKPACK DAY HIKE: https://amzn.to/2MvyhJB\nTENT: https://amzn.to/3pJHZGn\nSLEEPING BAG: https://amzn.to/38aQqVa\nBACKPACKING BOOTS HIGH: https://amzn.to/3b5aOJA\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

Set against a lush alpine backdrop with craggy peaks and glassy lakes, these three towers rise out of the ground like a cathedral of stone, creating plenty of opportunities for some spectacular photos.\n\nThe views from the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit are some of the best in the Dolomites, with picturesque churches perched on rocky outcrops, beautiful alpine lakes, and dramatic peaks and ridges. It\u2019s no wonder that this stunning corner of the Dolomites keeps travellers and hikers coming back again and again.\n\nThis region is also steeped in history, as it was once an important strategic site on the front line between Austria and Italy during World War One. The war left many scars on the surrounding landscape, including walls, fortifications, tunnels and trenches, many of which can be spotted during a hiking trip in the Dolomites. The area around Rifugio Locatelli is particularly well known for its trenches, which can be explored as part of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit.\n\nMore info : https://www.10adventures.com/hikes/the-dolomites/tre-cime-di-lavaredo/\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nNEW 8K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3q4k9GQ\nOLD 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3kwq2vF\nSMALL4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3i96R9G\u200b\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3f1VrTh\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/3l7FdeY\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/36GvP9V\nNew MICROPHONE: Rode Stereo VideoMic X\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3hKzU3h\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3f8Vo8h\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/36I7Ua8\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/3eLczg3\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/3iVfVhD\nBEST ND FILTER FOR GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/3yq60Ym\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2V1ezdh\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/2VLVWtH\nTHE BEST SD CARD : https://amzn.to/3x4Zh4c\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/3lkKtML\nMy BEST BACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3j0p2xs\nOLD GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/377GASY\nTHE BEST GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2Ryo0z8\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3rJ6Yfs\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/3l45IC3\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2VblnER\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/3BU81gY\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3rJ7qdE\u200b\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3rDCJqd\n\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/3l55U3Y\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/3rDrU7i\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3j1fodU\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3ycDQzA\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/2VgbrtV\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/2TE7mPy\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE EDITING MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3f7Btqa\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3762whd\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3zOPNvt\nAUDIO INTERFACE: https://amzn.to/3BRTvGD\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/3rFqFEF\n\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/3zMuYBa\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

This hike takes you above Santa Cristina Val Gardena and Ortisei. You will love the stunning Dolomite vistas, the little mountain huts and cabins sprinkled among the peaks and meadows make this walk a quintessential Dolomite trail.\n\nRoute Description for Seceda / Puez Odle:\nFrom the parking lot, take the Col Raiser Cable Car to the Col Raiser Almhotel. The hike starts from there. Follow the signs to Fermede and Seceda. While you walk, you will be able to see the Sassolungo massif on your left in all of its majesty, as well as the Sella Towers.\n\nKeep walking until you reach the Fermeda Rifugio. From there the hike will be steeper as you hike up the Seceda mountain. Following the well-signed path up, you\u2019ll walk near nice cottages and pastures.\n\nAfter all that elevation gain, it\u2019s not a bad idea to take a break at Baita Sofie, which is a few hundred meters away from your first goal.\n\nWalk along the path that runs next to Baita Sofie, you\u2019ll pass the Ristorante Seceda, gaining elevation on your way to the summit. From here you can also descend to Ortisei, and many people do this circuit starting at Ortisei instead of Santa Christina.\n\nOnce you get to a cross you\u2019ll notice you\u2019re at the summit. From there, you will see mountains in every direction. To help you understand what mountains you\u2019re looking at, there\u2019s an iron circle you can step on that has all the mountain peaks carved into it with their names.\n\nStarting from the South, you will be able to see Sassolungo and Passo Sella and down below the Alpe di Siusi. Then, proceeding clockwise: Catinaccio and Sciliar, the Saretine Alps, the Austrian Alps, The Piccolo and Grande Seceda, and the massive Sass Rigais.\n\nContinue along the path, which from now on will be descending and soon enter the Parco Naturale Puez-Odle. Continue on the path as it proceeds towards Pieralongia cottage, following the signed path. During your walk, you can admire all the Puez Mountains the Sella Towers and the Sassolungo. Below you, you will see some little alpine lakes and some peculiar wooden houses.\n\nAfter you reach the Rifugio Pieralongia, keep going straight for a little while. Then, you\u2019ll follow the signs that takes you back to the Col Raiser cable car, which will take you to your car.\n\ninfo source: https://www.10adventures.com/hikes/the-dolomites/seceda-puez-odle/\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nNEW 8K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3q4k9GQ\nOLD 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3kwq2vF\nSMALL4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3i96R9G\u200b\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3f1VrTh\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/3l7FdeY\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/36GvP9V\nNew MICROPHONE: Rode Stereo VideoMic X\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3hKzU3h\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3f8Vo8h\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/36I7Ua8\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/3eLczg3\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/3iVfVhD\nBEST ND FILTER FOR GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/3yq60Ym\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2V1ezdh\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/2VLVWtH\nTHE BEST SD CARD : https://amzn.to/3x4Zh4c\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/3lkKtML\nMy BEST BACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3j0p2xs\nOLD GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/377GASY\nTHE BEST GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2Ryo0z8\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3rJ6Yfs\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/3l45IC3\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2VblnER\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/3BU81gY\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3rJ7qdE\u200b\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3rDCJqd\n\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/3l55U3Y\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/3rDrU7i\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3j1fodU\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3ycDQzA\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/2VgbrtV\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/2TE7mPy\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE EDITING MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3f7Btqa\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3762whd\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3zOPNvt\nAUDIO INTERFACE: https://amzn.to/3BRTvGD\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/3rFqFEF\n\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/3zMuYBa\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

In the year 1831, woodcutters constructed a pathway through the 600 m long gorge. Nowadays, visitors can tour this imposing natural monument along its well-maintained pathways in about one hour.\n\nKnown as the gateway to the Weissbach Nature Park, Seisenberg Gorge serves as an ideal starting point for numerous hikes, while a number of stops for the shuttle bus are located along the way. A hike by torch light is offered once a week and, accompanied by live folk music, promises an extraordinary experience.\n\nThe Gorge Spirit turns any expedition through Seisenberg Gorge into an exciting experience.
