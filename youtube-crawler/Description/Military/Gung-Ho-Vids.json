The Blue Angels' signature \"Delta\" formation is composed of the pilots who fly in the #1 through #6 positions.\n\n(CLIP 2) Lt. Cmdr. Cary Rickoff, Blue Angel #6, conducts a training flight over NAF El Centro, CA and the Imperial Valley with Cmdr. Ben Walborn, Blue Angel #5. Here is a detailed breakdown of the maneuvers you see in clip 2: Lt. Cmdr Rickoff performs his first maneuver, the Low Transition to Immelman on take off. The maneuver begins from takeoff as he retracts his landing gear, maintaining minimum distance from the ground, then executes a high performance climb, followed by a half-loop. Next you see #6 executing a high G-force pull from behind the crowd, in order to expeditiously rendezvous with #5 for the next maneuver. The next maneuver is the Opposing Horizontal Roll. This maneuver requires #5 and #6 to perform two consecutive rolls, followed by the selection of max afterburner and execute a 7G pull to a vertical climb. The final maneuver of every show is the Pitch-Up Break (PUB). The PUB requires #1 through #6 to pitch up and away from the Delta Formation to deconflict their flight path. As they individually breakaway from the Delta Formation, they turn downwind, slowing down their aircraft in preparation for landing. \n\n(CLIP 3) Lt. Cmdr. Cary Rickoff, Blue Angel #6, conducts the Opposing Minimum-Radius Turn. In the Opposing Minimum-Radius Turn #5 and #6 approach from behind the crowd, passing over center point, while simultaneously rolling their aircraft 270 degrees away from each other, crossing each other\u2019s flight path. Aircraft #5 and #6 conduct the Minimum Radius Turn, to cross back once more over show center in front of the crowd. After crossing, #5 and #6 execute 3 1/2 rolls in the climb as they complete the maneuver.\n\nFilm Credits: Video by Petty Officer 2nd Class Cody Hendrix, Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron"

This training took place at Marana Regional Airport in Marana, Arizona on August 10, 2020.\n\nAs one of the only human based weapon systems in the Air Force, Guardian Angel must have highly trained personnel dedicated to the Air Force core function of Personnel Recovery. Guardian Angel is comprised of Combat Rescue Officers, Pararescuemen, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Specialists.The 68th Rescue Flight, also known as the Guardian Angel Formal Training Unit, was stood up in 2014 at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the 68th RQF and soon to be 68th Rescue Squadron is to provide standardized and efficient upgrade training for the entire Guardian Angel weapon system in order to support the Combatant Commanders Personnel Recovery requirements,\u201d said Capt. Michael \u201cJeff\u201d Ellingsen, 68th RQF commander.\n\nEllingsen relinquished command at a change of command ceremony and the 68th RQF transitioned to the 68th RQS on June 1, 2017.\n\n\u201cWe only had 25 positions assigns when we were initially stood up by CC,\u201d Ellingsen said. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting at about 44 personnel right now. That was enough to convert us to a full-fledged rescue squadron from a numbered flight.\u201d\n\nWith the growth of the squadron there is an increase in positions, the commander\u2019s billet is now an O-5 and the superintendent is an established E-9.\n\n\u201cNow that the 68th is converting to a full-fledged rescue squadron it\u2019s standardizing what Guardian Angel squadrons look like not only across the 23rd Wing, but the entire Air Force as well,\u201d Ellingsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty awesome to see where this place is going to be in the next three, five, ten years from now.\u201d\n\nThe 68th RQS focuses on training in three major courses: a pararescue team leader course, a mission qualification training course, and a U.S. Special Operations Command approved military freefall jumpmaster course.\n\nThis transition also allows for future growth in the form of new courses, new training and new upgrade opportunities for multitudes of Battlefield Airmen.\n\n\u201cGoing back to General Goldfien\u2019s priorities, squadrons are the fundamental building blocks of the Air Force,\u201d Ellingsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s where people live, that\u2019s where people reside, and that\u2019s where families and Airmen flourish.\u201d\n\nFilm Credits: Video by Senior Airman Blake Gonzales, 355th Wing"

It demonstrated advanced swarm behaviors such as collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing. \u201cDue to the complex nature of combat, Perdix are not pre-programmed synchronized individuals, they are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,\u201d said Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) Director William Roper. \u201cBecause every Perdix communicates and collaborates with every other Perdix, the swarm has no leader and can gracefully adapt to drones entering or exiting the team.\u201d The demonstration is one of the first examples of the Department of Defense using teams of small, inexpensive, autonomous systems to perform missions once achieved only by large, expensive ones. Originally designed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineering students, the Perdix drone was modified for military use by the scientists and engineers of MIT Lincoln Laboratory starting in 2013. Perdix is an expendable UAV designed to fly low to capture video and transmit it back to controllers. It could have numerous applications, though the SCO has only mentioned Perdix\u2019s ability to fly a low-altitude intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.\n \nFilm Credits: This work, Perdix Swarm Demo Oct. 2016, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

Over the years, the Warthog has become a legendary Close Air Support jet because of its huge 30mm gatling cannon (GAU-8) which fires depleted Uranium rounds capable of penetrating heavy armor, its long loiter time over targets, its high maneuverability, and its Titanium armor which contributes to survivability. In addition to having the deadly GAU-8, the Warthog can be armed with a variety of bombs and missiles adding to its lethality. If you check any list of \"best close air support aircraft\", you will find the A-10 Thunderbolt II Warthog is at the top of the list, or near the top of most every list you will find.

She was purchased in October 1952 for $250 In Seoul, Korea and trained to be a pack horse for the Recoilless Rifle Platoon, Anti-Tank Company, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. She served in numerous combat actions during the Korean War, carrying supplies and ammunition, and was also used to evacuate wounded. The highlight of her nine-month military career came in late March 1953 during the Battle for Outpost Vegas when, in a single day, she made 51 solo trips to resupply multiple front line units. She was wounded in combat twice, given the battlefield rank of corporal in 1953, and then a battlefield promotion to sergeant in 1954, then again to Staff Sergeant in 1959. She also became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing, and following the war was awarded two Purple Hearts, a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and was included in her unit's Presidential Unit Citations.

        "description": "The future USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) gets underway in Bath, Maine. The Zumwalt will be the world's most technologically advanced warship to date, using an integrated power system (IPS) to provide electric power for propulsion and ship services. The IPS generates approximately 78 megawatts of power, nearly what a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier generates. It will be able to meet the total ship electric power requirements and provide extra capacity to accommodate future weapons and computing systems. In addition to its advanced propulsion systems, Zumwalt is much larger than today's destroyers. At 610 feet long and 80.7 feet wide, Zumwalt is 100 feet longer, with a flight deck that is 93 percent larger than an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The U.S. Navy's newest guided-missile destroyer is still designated PCU Zumwalt (pre-commissioned unit) until it is commissioned in Baltimore, Maryland on Oct. 15, 2016.  Filmed on September 7, 2016. More information on the technology of USS Zumwalt here: http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-americas-lethal-new-stealth-destroyer-16306\n                           \nFilm Credits: United States Navy Video/Released"

The Patriot system is a long-range, all-altitude, all-weather air defense system to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft. It is in service in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.\n\nDeveloped by Raytheon, the Patriot missile is equipped with a track-via-missile (TVM) guidance system. Midcourse correction commands are transmitted to the guidance system from a control center.\n\nThe target acquisition system in the missile acquires the target in the terminal phase of flight and transmits the data using the TVM downlink via the ground radar to the control station for final course corrections and calculations. The course correction commands are transmitted to the missile via the missile track command uplink. The high-explosive 90kg warhead is situated behind the terminal guidance section.\n\nThe range of the missile is 70km and maximum altitude is greater than 24km. The minimum flight time is less than 9 seconds, and the maximum flight time is less than 3.5 minutes.\n\nSince 2010, Raytheon has developed the Patriot guidance enhanced missile (GEM-T). The upgrade involves a new fuse and the insertion of a new low noise oscillator, which increases the seeker sensitivity to low radar cross-section targets. The GEM-T missile provides an upgraded capability to defeat air-breathing, cruise, and ballistic missiles. More than 1000 GEM-Ts are now in service.\n\nFilm Credits:  SrA Zachary Boyer"

The extra range comes from tail fins and canards for in-flight adjustments and to make the round glide as it descends, and the greater lethality is a result of this flight path - normal artillery rounds impact at a 45 degree angle, which blows the top half of the round straight up into the air, but descending at a sharp angle places more energy and fragmentation directly on a target. \n\nFilm Credits:  MSgt Bryce Piper, Sgt Paul Robbins, Sgt Joseph Scanlan"

David's Sling is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to intercept medium to long-range rockets and cruise missiles fired at ranges from 40 km (24.85 miles) to 300 km (186.41 miles). It is designed to intercept the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles, such as Iskander, using an on-board dual CCD/IR seekers to distinguish between decoys and the actual warhead of the missile. David's Sling is meant to bolster the second tier of Israel's theater missile defense system. The two-stage radar and electro-optic guided system has a 70-300 kilometer range, three times that of Iron Dome. The system can be deployed against aircraft and missiles, with plans to convert the system to intercept cruise missiles in the future. DST-4 was the final milestone before declaring delivery of an operational system to the Israeli Air Force in 2016. Filmed on December 21, 2015.\n\nhttp://www.mda.mil/\n\nFilm Credits: Leah Garton"

It is certainly the most expensive military weapons system ever developed over the entire projected lifetime of the program. Although the F-35 has been the object of much criticism, the United States is going \"full-tilt\" ahead with the project, and three variants of the fighter jet are being built and are in various stages of testing and deployment... F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing) for the Air Force, F-35B (short take-off and vertical-landing) for the Marine Corps, and F-35C (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) for the Navy. If Lockheed Martin can fulfill it's promises, the F-35 may well be the most effective military aircraft on Earth. But those promises are very lofty. So love it or hate it, the F-35 Lightning II is here to stay... and time will tell the full story of this aircraft.

The MQ-9 Reaper is the most deadly remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in the U.S. Air Force arsenal as of this time - having more ordnance handling capability than the MQ-1 Predator drone.\n\nThe 174th Attack Wing is the first Air Force organization in the United States to fly an RPA in class \"C\" airspace, the common airspace around commercial airports. \n\nPrior to this date all flight operations of the MQ-9 aircraft were conducted at Wheeler Sack Army Airfield at Fort Drum. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted approval for the 174th to begin launch and recovery operations with the MQ-9 Reaper drone from Hancock Field Air National Guard Base and the Syracuse International Airport this week.\n\nThe FAA approval follows a technical and operational review for the safe and effective takeoff and recovery of MQ-9 aircraft at Hancock Field, home to operator and maintenance training of MQ-9 crews. The FAA modified airspace around Hancock Field in 2013 to expand available training areas and provide transition from high altitude down to Hancock Field. \n\nThe 174th Attack Wing was established in 1947 as the first Air National Guard flying unit in New York State. Throughout its history, it has flown F-47 Thunderbolts, F-51 Mustangs, F-84 Thunderjets, F-86 Sabres, A-37 Dragonflies, A-10 Thunderbolts and the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

The Phalanx CIWS (pronounced sea-whiz) is primarily a close-in weapon system for defense against anti-ship missiles. It consists of a radar-guided 20 mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling base and is used by the U.S. Navy on every class of surface combat ship. The CIWS is designed to be the last line of defense against anti-ship missiles, with an effective range Of 1-5 nautical miles and 4,500 rounds per minute rate-of-fire.\n\nThe CIWS has two antennas that work together to engage targets. The first antenna is for searching. The search antenna provides bearing, range, velocity, heading, and altitude information to the computer. This information is analyzed to determine whether the object should be engaged. Once the computer identifies a target, the CIWS pivots to face the target and then hands the target over to the tracking antenna. The tracking antenna observes the target until the computer determines that the probability of a successful hit is maximized and then the system will either fire automatically or will recommend fire to the operator. While firing, the system tracks outgoing rounds and \"walks\" them onto the target.\n\nFilm Credits: PO1 Henry Dunphy, PO3 Samuel Souvannason, PO3 David Flewellyn, PO3 Patrick Dionne, PO3 David Flewellyn"

The Ronald Reagan will then replace the George Washington in Japan as the Navy's forward-deployed aircraft carrier, and the George Washington will sail to Norfolk, Virginia to complete a multi-year nuclear refueling and overhaul.  \n\n\nFilm Credits: This work, USS George Washington Leaves Japan Broll, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law. https://www.dvidshub.net/video/404757/uss-george-washington-leaves-japan-broll#.VVoCdSFVikp"

The new transport vehicle is being considered by the U.S. Marine Corps as a replacement for it's 20 year old fleet of LCAC hovercrafts. The UHAC travels across water much like an old river paddleboat did in years past.\n\nAlthough the UHAC prototype appears slow and cumbersome, the full production model now on the drawing board will have some distinct advantages over LCAC hovercrafts currently deployed by the Marine Corps. The full sized UHAC (the prototype in this video is only 4/10 scale) has a deckspace of 2500 square feet, significantly larger when compared to the LCAC's 1800. Plus, the UHAC can carry three M-1 Abrams tanks, or up to 190 tons. In contrast, the LCAC can carry one M-1 or 65 tons.\n\nWith the added advantage of the UHAC's ability to transport cargo inland after landing on the beach, you can see why the Marines are giving this massive vehicle a lot of thought. All things considered, it will be very interesting to watch a full sized UHAC display it's capabilities.\n\nFilm & Image Credits: Kyle Olson, GySgt Jeremy Vought, Cpl Matthew Bragg, MSgt Ryan Kruse, LCpl Aaron Patterson \nDerivative Works: Gung Ho Vids"

It can launch six rockets at a target of up to 26 miles away.\n\nOn February 14, 2010, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan said that it was thought that two rockets fired from a HIMARS unit fell 300 metres short of their intended target and killed 12 civilians during Operation Moshtarak. So, ISAF suspended the use of the HIMARS until a full review of the incident was completed. Later it was confirmed that the rockets were on target, that the target was in use by the Taliban, and use of the system was reinstated. \n\nReports indicate that the civilian deaths were due to the Taliban's use of an occupied dwelling, and the presence of civilians at that location was not known to the ISAF forces. An October 21, 2010 report in the New York Times credited HIMARS with aiding the NATO offensive in Kandahar by targeting Taliban commanders' hideouts, forcing many to flee to Pakistan, at least temporarily.\n\nFilm Credit: Sgt Michael Ito"
