As the Air Force’s only combat mission ready F-35A units, the 388th and 419th FWs must be prepared to launch any number of aircraft to support the national defense mission at a moment’s notice. The wings fly between 30-60 sorties per day from Hill’s flight line. During the exercise, they launched roughly the same number of sorties, and aircraft took off in 20 to 40-second intervals.\n\n During the exercise, the wings confirmed their ability to employ a large force of jets against air and ground targets, demonstrating the readiness and lethality of the F-35 Lightning II. As the first combat-ready F-35 units in the Air Force, the 388th and 419th FWs are ready to deploy anywhere in the world at a moment’s notice.\n\nThe Combat Power Exercise demonstrates the ability to employ a large force of F-35As - testing readiness in the areas of personnel accountability, aircraft generation, ground operations, flight operations, and combat capability against air and ground targets.\n\nThe Ultimate Military Archive covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!

        "description": "Hundreds of thousands of people were still without power, dozens of roads remained closed in Lake Charles and other areas and residents across the region were cleaning up damage Saturday as the remnants of Hurricane Delta continued to push inland across the South.\n\nLouisiana took the brunt of hurricane damage for a second time this year, after being pummeled by Hurricane Laura about six weeks ago. More than 9,400 people were being sheltered by the state Saturday, The Associated Press reported, citing Gov. John Bel Edwards. Nearly all of them were Laura evacuees.\n\nThe governor said 3,000 National Guard troops were mobilized after Delta and 10,000 utility workers were fanned out across the region.\n\nWeary residents began to return home and assess the damage in Lake Charles, where Patrick King waded thorugh knee-deep water to get his home after spending Friday night in Beaumont, Texas.\n\n“I was hoping and praying that it didn’t get into the house, but it did. It rose up close to the furniture,” King told the AP.\n\nIn the nearby community of Iowa, Brian Schexnayder’s home was badly damaged by Laura. Friday night, Hurricane Delta brought more misery.\n\n“In the first five minutes, it blew the tarp off,” Schexnayder, 62, told nola.com.\n\nRain came down into every room.\n\nDelta dumped record amounts of rain in some parts of Louisiana, causing flash flooding that stranded cars, made roads impassable and sent water into homes. More than a foot of rain fell in parts of Lake Charles.\n\n\"I'll take all the thoughts and prayers I can get right now,\" Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter told CNN.\n\nAbout 7,000 residents of Lake Charles had not been able to return to their homes since they were damaged by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago, Hunter said. Across the city, Hurricane Delta on Friday ripped tarps off the damaged buildings as if they were bright blue Band-Aids.\n\nMore than 497,000 customers were without power in Louisiana as of about 4 p.m. CDT Saturday, according to poweroutage.us. Another 87,000 outages were being reported in Texas, and Mississippi had more than 39,000. Thousands in Arkansas and Alabama also had no electricity. At one point Saturday morning, more than 800,000 homes and businesses along the Gulf Coast were without power.\n\nRead more: https://weather.com/news/news/2020-10-10-hurricane-delta-impacts-louisiana-texas-mississippi-alabama",

        "description": "Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung was erupting Tuesday, sending volcanic materials as high as 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky and depositing ash on nearby villages.\n\nActivity at the volcano in North Sumatra province increased over the past week, with authorities recording 13 times when it released ash clouds.\n\nThere have been no fresh evacuations due to the activity and no reports of disruptions to flights in the region.\n\nThe 2,600-metre (8,530-feet) Sinabung was dormant for four centuries before erupting in 2010, killing two people. Another eruption in 2014 killed 17 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.\n\nThe volcano, one of two currently erupting in Indonesia, has sporadically come to life since then.\n\nSome 30,000 people have been forced to leave homes around Sinabung in the past few years.\n\nSinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is located on the \"Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Ocean.\n\nRead more: https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/indonesias-sinabung-volcano-spews-high-column-ash-76195168\n\n#gunung #sinabung #erupsi",

        "description": "Hundreds of people were told to evacuate their homes on Thursday as wildfires swept through several counties in the Florida Panhandle, the authorities said.\n\nThe largest wildfire stretched across 2,000 acres in Santa Rosa County, in the northwestern part of the state, the authorities said. The fire broke out on Monday afternoon, grew as it was fanned by high winds and low humidity, and by Thursday morning it was 35 percent contained, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said in a statement.\n\nWinds of more than 20 miles per hour picked up embers and carried them across Interstate 10, which runs east-west through Florida, the department said. Portions of the highway were shut down.\n\nAs of early Thursday, about 1,100 people had evacuated their homes in Santa Rosa County. “That is going to continue through at least today,” said Joe Zwierzchowski, a Florida Forest Service spokesman.\n\nDozens of homes and multiple structures have been lost to the flames, he said, and the county has opened emergency shelters.\n\nMichael Dunlavy, his wife, Haley, and their five sons could see the smoke and flames from five fires several miles from their house in Milton, a city in Santa Rosa County, on Wednesday. Around noon, they received the order to evacuate. “First we went outside and looked around,” he said. “It really did not seem like it could reach us, but it was moving pretty fast.”\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/florida-wildfire.html",

        "description": "Vietnam deployed hundreds of soldiers and heavy machinery on Thursday to search for survivors after landslides triggered by torrential rains from Typhoon Molave, one of the strongest typhoons in the region in decades, the government said.\n\nThe landslides, which hit remote areas in the central province of Quang Nam a day earlier, killed 13 with 40 missing as rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather at the tail end of the storm, the government said.\n\n\"We can forecast the storm path or the amount of rain, but can't predict when landslides happen,\" deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said in a statement.\n\n\"The road is covered under deep mud and heavy rains are still lashing the area, but rescue work has to be carried out quickly.\"\n\nSince early October, Vietnam has been battered by storms, heavy rains and floods which have affected more than a million people.\n\nThe government said Typhoon Molave -- also known as Quinta -- had left millions of people without electricity and damaged 56,000 houses.\n\nTwenty-six fishermen also remain missing after their boats sank when trying to return to shore on Tuesday.\n\nMolave has weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall on Wednesday and is expected to reach Laos later on Thursday.\n\nHeavy rain of up to 700 millimeters (27.5 inches) will continue in parts of central Vietnam until Saturday, Vietnam's weather agency said.\n\nRead more: https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/28/asia/vietnam-typhoon-molave-destruction-intl-hnk/index.html\n\n#molave #bão #bãosố9",

When looking at a tornado in the distance, you might not know what is going on around or even inside that tornado. From a distance, it might even look peaceful. But once you get up close and personal, tornadoes become extremely frightening. When you are close to or inside of a tornado, the true power of it shows.

        "description": "A volcano in the southern Caribbean that had been dormant for decades erupted in a billowing blast of gray smoke Friday, spewing clouds of ash for miles and forcing thousands to evacuate.\n\nThe volcano, known as La Soufrière, on the northern tip of the main island of St. Vincent, in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, had started showing signs of renewed activity in late December. It moved into an “explosive state” on Friday morning, the National Emergency Management Organization said in a Twitter posting.\n\nThe emergency management agency said that the ash fall had been registered as far as the country’s international airport on the southern part of the island — more than 12 miles away —  while an ash plume had billowed 20,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVideo clips shot in Chateaubelair, a town on the foothills of the volcano, showed the sky darkened by ash as people wearing face masks trudged through the streets lugging their belongings.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties from the eruption, and the extent of any damage in the surrounding area was unclear.\n\nThe eruption came a day after officials had raised the alert level following several small tremors detected at the volcano, with clouds of steam seen erupting from its peak. The country’s prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, ordered a full evacuation of the area.\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/world/americas/volcano-St-Vincent-eruption-caribbean.html\n\n#LaSoufriere #volcano #eruption",

She was a very nice dog and the next day when the storm was over I gave her to someone in town and they were going to get her to her owners. Video copyright by Mike Theiss.",

This includes the entire chase, from first approach of a tornado producing supercell, to leaving the storm after its last tornado at nightfall. This was the December 1, 2018 tornado outbreak over west central Illinois. Timing on the tornado tracks is a rough estimate using the National Weather Service's damage surveys. I corrected some errors in the survey tracks and timings, but they still don't line up perfectly with the video in spots. Playback speed is 16x.",

        "description": "Some people ask a version without music  ;)  so here it !\n\nEnjoy my virtual walk and nice scenery @ Crator Lake National Park in 4K !\n\nCrater Lake (Klamath: giiwas) is a crater lake in south-central Oregon in the western United States. It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot (655 m)-deep caldera  that was formed around 7,700 (± 150) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama. There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years. With a depth of 1,949 feet (594 m), the lake is the deepest in the United States. In the world, it ranks ninth for maximum depth, and third for mean (average) depth.\n\nCrater Lake features two small islands. Wizard Island, located near the western shore of the lake, is a cinder cone approximately 316 acres (128 ha) in size. Phantom Ship, a natural rock pillar, is located near the southern shore.\n\nSince 2002, one of the state's regular-issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake and a one-time plate surcharge is used to support the operation of Crater Lake National Park. The commemorative Oregon State Quarter, which was released by the United States Mint in 2005, features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse.\n\nThe lake and surrounding park areas offer many recreational activities including hiking, biking, snowshoeing, fishing, and cross-country skiing are available, and during the summer, campgrounds and lodges at Crater Lake are open to visitors.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thedutchmen\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nMAIN CAMERA: https://amzn.to/389LIr6\nSMALL 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2X2LPOE\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3hPkx8d\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/2Laj8go\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3ngq8FG\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/3hPkN7b\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/2X6quEc\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/38ULxz0\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2MqaXwF\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/3omJHNy \nSD CARD: https://amzn.to/3hBHzPA\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/2KZC2qf\nBACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2Lh8hRk\nGIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2X3k3Bt\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3pL48UR\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/352VNE2\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/389bsUf\nACCESSORIES CASE: https://amzn.to/2X5EopT\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/38RqHjU\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3b1nX67\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3hBzWJ3\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/2X8kjzn\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/3pDs4cG\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/389Nj04\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/390bVaw\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3pWNYYP\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3oennFZ\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3b4WNLB\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/38bupG5\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3pIh5i5\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2X5kOtZ\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3hDI23F\nAUDIO INTERFACE:https://amzn.to/2JHXu2o\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/2MvFYiT\nKEYBOARD: https://amzn.to/38UUMix\nMOUSE: https://amzn.to/350i45x\nHEADPHONE: https://amzn.to/2KZEw83\nSATA DOCKING STATION: https://amzn.to/3ocjtNJ\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/2LhaR9Y\n\nHIKING GEAR:\nBACKPACK: https://amzn.to/3pKHo7k\nBACKPACK DAY HIKE: https://amzn.to/2MvyhJB\nTENT: https://amzn.to/3pJHZGn\nSLEEPING BAG: https://amzn.to/38aQqVa\nBACKPACKING BOOTS HIGH: https://amzn.to/3b5aOJA\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

Set against a lush alpine backdrop with craggy peaks and glassy lakes, these three towers rise out of the ground like a cathedral of stone, creating plenty of opportunities for some spectacular photos.\n\nThe views from the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit are some of the best in the Dolomites, with picturesque churches perched on rocky outcrops, beautiful alpine lakes, and dramatic peaks and ridges. It’s no wonder that this stunning corner of the Dolomites keeps travellers and hikers coming back again and again.\n\nThis region is also steeped in history, as it was once an important strategic site on the front line between Austria and Italy during World War One. The war left many scars on the surrounding landscape, including walls, fortifications, tunnels and trenches, many of which can be spotted during a hiking trip in the Dolomites. The area around Rifugio Locatelli is particularly well known for its trenches, which can be explored as part of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit.\n\nMore info : https://www.10adventures.com/hikes/the-dolomites/tre-cime-di-lavaredo/\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nNEW 8K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3q4k9GQ\nOLD 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3kwq2vF\nSMALL4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3i96R9G​\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3f1VrTh\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/3l7FdeY\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/36GvP9V\nNew MICROPHONE: Rode Stereo VideoMic X\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3hKzU3h\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3f8Vo8h\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/36I7Ua8\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/3eLczg3\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/3iVfVhD\nBEST ND FILTER FOR GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/3yq60Ym\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2V1ezdh\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/2VLVWtH\nTHE BEST SD CARD : https://amzn.to/3x4Zh4c\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/3lkKtML\nMy BEST BACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3j0p2xs\nOLD GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/377GASY\nTHE BEST GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2Ryo0z8\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3rJ6Yfs\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/3l45IC3\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2VblnER\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/3BU81gY\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3rJ7qdE​\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3rDCJqd\n\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/3l55U3Y\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/3rDrU7i\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3j1fodU\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3ycDQzA\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/2VgbrtV\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/2TE7mPy\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE EDITING MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3f7Btqa\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3762whd\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3zOPNvt\nAUDIO INTERFACE: https://amzn.to/3BRTvGD\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/3rFqFEF\n\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/3zMuYBa\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

        "description": "#nationalpark #Oregon #Cratorlake\nEnjoy my virtual hike and nice scenery @ Crater Lake National Park in 4K !\n\nCrater Lake (Klamath: giiwas) is a crater lake in south-central Oregon in the western United States. It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot (655 m)-deep caldera  that was formed around 7,700 (± 150) years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama. There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years. With a depth of 1,949 feet (594 m), the lake is the deepest in the United States. In the world, it ranks ninth for maximum depth, and third for mean (average) depth.\n\nCrater Lake features two small islands. Wizard Island, located near the western shore of the lake, is a cinder cone approximately 316 acres (128 ha) in size. Phantom Ship, a natural rock pillar, is located near the southern shore.\n\nSince 2002, one of the state's regular-issue license plate designs has featured Crater Lake and a one-time plate surcharge is used to support the operation of Crater Lake National Park. The commemorative Oregon State Quarter, which was released by the United States Mint in 2005, features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse.\n\nThe lake and surrounding park areas offer many recreational activities including hiking, biking, snowshoeing, fishing, and cross-country skiing are available, and during the summer, campgrounds and lodges at Crater Lake are open to visitors.\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thedutchmen\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nMAIN CAMERA: https://amzn.to/389LIr6\nSMALL 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2X2LPOE\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3hPkx8d\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/2Laj8go\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3ngq8FG\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/3hPkN7b\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/2X6quEc\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/38ULxz0\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2MqaXwF\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/3omJHNy \nSD CARD: https://amzn.to/3hBHzPA\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/2KZC2qf\nBACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2Lh8hRk\nGIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2X3k3Bt\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3pL48UR\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/352VNE2\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/389bsUf\nACCESSORIES CASE: https://amzn.to/2X5EopT\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/38RqHjU\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3b1nX67\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3hBzWJ3\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/2X8kjzn\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/3pDs4cG\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/389Nj04\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/390bVaw\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3pWNYYP\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3oennFZ\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3b4WNLB\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/38bupG5\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3pIh5i5\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2X5kOtZ\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3hDI23F\nAUDIO INTERFACE:https://amzn.to/2JHXu2o\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/2MvFYiT\nKEYBOARD: https://amzn.to/38UUMix\nMOUSE: https://amzn.to/350i45x\nHEADPHONE: https://amzn.to/2KZEw83\nSATA DOCKING STATION: https://amzn.to/3ocjtNJ\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/2LhaR9Y\n\nHIKING GEAR:\nBACKPACK: https://amzn.to/3pKHo7k\nBACKPACK DAY HIKE: https://amzn.to/2MvyhJB\nTENT: https://amzn.to/3pJHZGn\nSLEEPING BAG: https://amzn.to/38aQqVa\nBACKPACKING BOOTS HIGH: https://amzn.to/3b5aOJA\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

        "description": "Seisenbergklamm The Best Canyon Walk in Austria!\n\nEnjoy my Seisenbergklamm virtual walk in 4K quality !\n\nThe history of Seisenberg Gorge, which is located in Weissbach near Lofer, began some 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. In the year 1831, woodcutters constructed a pathway through the 600 m long gorge. Nowadays, visitors can tour this imposing natural monument along its well-maintained pathways in about one hour.\n\nKnown as the gateway to the Weissbach Nature Park, Seisenberg Gorge serves as an ideal starting point for numerous hikes, while a number of stops for the shuttle bus are located along the way. A hike by torch light is offered once a week and, accompanied by live folk music, promises an extraordinary experience.\n\nThe Gorge Spirit turns any expedition through Seisenberg Gorge into an exciting experience. At several stops along the way, it will share fascinating facts about nature and the environment in the area.\nsource info: https://www.naturgewalten.at/english/seisenberg-gorge/\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nNEW 8K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3q4k9GQ\nOLD 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3kwq2vF\nSMALL4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3i96R9G​\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3f1VrTh\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/3l7FdeY\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/36GvP9V\nNew MICROPHONE: Rode Stereo VideoMic X\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3hKzU3h\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3f8Vo8h\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/36I7Ua8\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/3eLczg3\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/3iVfVhD\nBEST ND FILTER FOR GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/3yq60Ym\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2V1ezdh\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/2VLVWtH\nTHE BEST SD CARD : https://amzn.to/3x4Zh4c\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/3lkKtML\nMy BEST BACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3j0p2xs\nOLD GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/377GASY\nTHE BEST GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2Ryo0z8\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3rJ6Yfs\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/3l45IC3\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2VblnER\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/3BU81gY\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3rJ7qdE​\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3rDCJqd\n\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/3l55U3Y\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/3rDrU7i\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3j1fodU\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3ycDQzA\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/2VgbrtV\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/2TE7mPy\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE EDITING MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3f7Btqa\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3762whd\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3zOPNvt\nAUDIO INTERFACE: https://amzn.to/3BRTvGD\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/3rFqFEF\n\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/3zMuYBa\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

        "description": "With Epic Views Of Seceda !\n\nDistance: 12.4km\nTime: 3.5-4.5h\nElevation:446m\n\nWalking in the Puez Odle Natural Park is stunning. This hike takes you above Santa Cristina Val Gardena and Ortisei. You will love the stunning Dolomite vistas, the little mountain huts and cabins sprinkled among the peaks and meadows make this walk a quintessential Dolomite trail.\n\nRoute Description for Seceda / Puez Odle:\nFrom the parking lot, take the Col Raiser Cable Car to the Col Raiser Almhotel. The hike starts from there. Follow the signs to Fermede and Seceda. While you walk, you will be able to see the Sassolungo massif on your left in all of its majesty, as well as the Sella Towers.\n\nKeep walking until you reach the Fermeda Rifugio. From there the hike will be steeper as you hike up the Seceda mountain. Following the well-signed path up, you’ll walk near nice cottages and pastures.\n\nAfter all that elevation gain, it’s not a bad idea to take a break at Baita Sofie, which is a few hundred meters away from your first goal.\n\nWalk along the path that runs next to Baita Sofie, you’ll pass the Ristorante Seceda, gaining elevation on your way to the summit. From here you can also descend to Ortisei, and many people do this circuit starting at Ortisei instead of Santa Christina.\n\nOnce you get to a cross you’ll notice you’re at the summit. From there, you will see mountains in every direction. To help you understand what mountains you’re looking at, there’s an iron circle you can step on that has all the mountain peaks carved into it with their names.\n\nStarting from the South, you will be able to see Sassolungo and Passo Sella and down below the Alpe di Siusi. Then, proceeding clockwise: Catinaccio and Sciliar, the Saretine Alps, the Austrian Alps, The Piccolo and Grande Seceda, and the massive Sass Rigais.\n\nContinue along the path, which from now on will be descending and soon enter the Parco Naturale Puez-Odle. Continue on the path as it proceeds towards Pieralongia cottage, following the signed path. During your walk, you can admire all the Puez Mountains the Sella Towers and the Sassolungo. Below you, you will see some little alpine lakes and some peculiar wooden houses.\n\nAfter you reach the Rifugio Pieralongia, keep going straight for a little while. Then, you’ll follow the signs that takes you back to the Col Raiser cable car, which will take you to your car.\n\ninfo source: https://www.10adventures.com/hikes/the-dolomites/seceda-puez-odle/\n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nNEW 8K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3q4k9GQ\nOLD 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3kwq2vF\nSMALL4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3i96R9G​\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3f1VrTh\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/3l7FdeY\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/36GvP9V\nNew MICROPHONE: Rode Stereo VideoMic X\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3hKzU3h\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3f8Vo8h\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/36I7Ua8\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/3eLczg3\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/3iVfVhD\nBEST ND FILTER FOR GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/3yq60Ym\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2V1ezdh\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/2VLVWtH\nTHE BEST SD CARD : https://amzn.to/3x4Zh4c\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/3lkKtML\nMy BEST BACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3j0p2xs\nOLD GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/377GASY\nTHE BEST GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2Ryo0z8\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3rJ6Yfs\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/3l45IC3\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2VblnER\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/3BU81gY\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3rJ7qdE​\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3rDCJqd\n\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/3l55U3Y\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/3rDrU7i\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3j1fodU\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3ycDQzA\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/2VgbrtV\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/2TE7mPy\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE EDITING MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3f7Btqa\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/3762whd\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3zOPNvt\nAUDIO INTERFACE: https://amzn.to/3BRTvGD\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/3rFqFEF\n\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/3zMuYBa\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

        "description": "Enjoy my virtual Hike and nice scenery @ Hoh Rain Forest Olympic National Park Washington\nwatch on 4K Tv for best quality\nWith an annual rainfall ranging from 140 to 170 inches, the Hoh Rain Forest is a lush, green wonderland, with mosses and ferns covering every tree and surface. According to the NPS, it is one of the finest remaining examples of temperate rainforest in the United States and is one of the park's most popular spots to visit. One visitor described walking in the forest as a \"Hansel and Gretel-type of feeling\" while another likened it to a fairy tale enchanted forest.\n\nMost travelers begin at the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center, which is staffed with rangers who can offer advice on what to see and do. The visitor center also houses exhibits and a bookstore. Two short nature trails loop through the forest near the center, the Hall of Mosses Trail (.8 miles) and the Spruce Nature Trail (1.2 miles). If you're up to the challenge, there is also a 17-mile trail that leads to Glacier Meadows, on the shoulder of Mount Olympus, called the Hoh River Trail.\n\nThe Hoh sits on the west side of Olympic National Park, about a two-hour drive from Port Angeles and less than an hour from Forks, Washington. It can be accessed via Upper Hoh Road, off of Highway 101. The visitor center, which is free to access, is open daily during the summer, generally open Friday through Sunday in the spring and fall (hours may vary) and closed December through early March. \n\nIf you are a youtuber you need Tubebuddy !\n\nTubeBuddy is a browser extension built for YouTube creators that can save hours of time, \nhelp optimize videos, help engage with audience! ... \nTubebuddy will find the best TAGS for you to grow your YouTube Channel !\nIt worked for me !\n\nFollow this link : https://www.tubebuddy.com/thedutchmen\n\nMAIN GEAR:\nMAIN CAMERA: https://amzn.to/389LIr6\nSMALL 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/2X2LPOE\nACTION CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3hPkx8d\nTHE BEST SUCTION CUP CAR MOUNT: https://amzn.to/2Laj8go\nACTION CAMERA BITE MOUNT MOUNT: https://amzn.to/3ngq8FG\nMAIN LENS: https://amzn.to/3hPkN7b\nZOOM LENS: https://amzn.to/2X6quEc\nFILTER CIRCULAR ND KIT: https://amzn.to/38ULxz0\nCPL FILTER: https://amzn.to/2MqaXwF\nLENS CLEANING KIT:  https://amzn.to/3omJHNy \nSD CARD: https://amzn.to/3hBHzPA\nMICRO SD CARD: https://amzn.to/2KZC2qf\nBACKUP DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2Lh8hRk\nGIMBAL: https://amzn.to/2X3k3Bt\nSMALL GIMBAL FOR POCKET 4K CAMERA: https://amzn.to/3pL48UR\nTRANSMOUNT QUICK SETUP KIT: https://amzn.to/352VNE2\nEXTRA TRIPOD STAND GIMBAL: https://amzn.to/389bsUf\nACCESSORIES CASE: https://amzn.to/2X5EopT\nBATTERY CHARGER + 2x BATTERY: https://amzn.to/38RqHjU\nLOW PROFILE BAL HEAD 360 : https://amzn.to/3b1nX67\nCAMERA SLIDER: https://amzn.to/3hBzWJ3\nMICROPHONE 1: https://amzn.to/2X8kjzn\nMICROPHONE 2: https://amzn.to/3pDs4cG\nAUDIO RECORDER: https://amzn.to/389Nj04\nAUDIO RECORDER CASE: https://amzn.to/390bVaw\nCAMERA BAG SMALL: https://amzn.to/3pWNYYP\nCAMERA BAG NORMAL: https://amzn.to/3oennFZ\nFIELD MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3b4WNLB\nGREY CARD:   https://amzn.to/38bupG5\n\nDESK GEAR:\nULTRA WIDE MONITOR: https://amzn.to/3pIh5i5\nHDD DRIVES: https://amzn.to/2X5kOtZ\nGRAPHICS CARD: https://amzn.to/3hDI23F\nAUDIO INTERFACE:https://amzn.to/2JHXu2o\nSTUDIO SPEAKERS: https://amzn.to/2MvFYiT\nKEYBOARD: https://amzn.to/38UUMix\nMOUSE: https://amzn.to/350i45x\nHEADPHONE: https://amzn.to/2KZEw83\nSATA DOCKING STATION: https://amzn.to/3ocjtNJ\nLAPTOP: https://amzn.to/2LhaR9Y\n\nHIKING GEAR:\nBACKPACK: https://amzn.to/3pKHo7k\nBACKPACK DAY HIKE: https://amzn.to/2MvyhJB\nTENT: https://amzn.to/3pJHZGn\nSLEEPING BAG: https://amzn.to/38aQqVa\nBACKPACKING BOOTS HIGH: https://amzn.to/3b5aOJA\n\nBy using the affiliate links i earn a small fee of your purchase, it does not cost you anything extra to use them.

Outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park, this is Wild America with My Own Frontier.\n\nWatch part 1 here: https://youtu.be/t6tgApz_2NM\n\nThis day 4-8 of an 8 day backpacking trip with my buddy Joey of @myownfrontier in the Greater Yellowstone, Teton Wilderness area. This is Wild America at its best as far as my experience goes. We go into some of the most wild and remote areas of the lower 48 states and find the headwaters of the Mighty Yellowstone River in the previous video, in this video we find the headwaters of Thorofare Creek. Amazing vistas and views as we traverse the Continental Divide in the middle of an incredible wildflower bloom. Stunning waterfalls, meadows, mountains and creek crossings everywhere in prime Grizzly country. This part showing days 4-8 takes us from the North Fork of the Yellowstone River, over to and through the Thorofare Creek drainage, Open Valley, Overlook Mountain, Overlook Mountain Pass, Glacier Basin, Rampart Creek and much more. We didnt see any people except for the first and last day. This trip is from outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park.\n\nMusic by Melantopia\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/536Z5d0oUiDqAuYLlsTDtG?si=ADG6SEp4QliDxhMeGHqnVA\n\nhttps://music.apple.com/no/artist/melantopia/1176297721\n\nGear Used:\nMarmot tent https://www.youtube.com/user/marmotpro\nMarmot ball cap https://www.youtube.com/user/marmotpro\nOsprey Aether 70 Backpack https://www.youtube.com/user/ospreypacks\nParia Outdoor Products Thermodown 15 sleeping bag https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoC1PBxejxpzdInYW4dbJ4g\nThermarest NeoAir Xtherm sleeping pad https://www.youtube.com/user/ThermarestGear\nUrsac https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0LCCbs7icRlibynSH57Jw\nLaSportiva TX4 approach shoes https://www.youtube.com/user/LaSportivaNA\nNorrøna Falketind pants https://www.youtube.com/user/NorronaSport\nFjallraven pants https://www.youtube.com/user/FjallravenSE\nArcteryx Cerium LT puffy, synthetic shirt and Hard Shell Jacket\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/arcteryxequipmentinc\nLaSportiva fleece https://www.youtube.com/user/LaSportivatube\nHelly Hansen base layers https://www.youtube.com/user/hellyhansen\nBlack Diamond headlamp https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackDiamondVideo\nPrimus cooking system https://www.youtube.com/user/PrimusChannel\nApple Iphone 11promax for recording video https://www.youtube.com/user/Apple\n26000Mah power bank\nAlltrails app https://www.youtube.com/user/alltrailsinc\nWalmart 4,99 $ Tube https://www.youtube.com/user/Walmart\nPetzl Ice Axe https://www.youtube.com/user/petzlcrew\nPatagonia puffy https://www.youtube.com/user/patagoniavideo\nOutdoor Research Gaiters https://www.youtube.com/user/OutdoorResearch\nBlack Diamond Crampons\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:34 Headwaters of the Yellowstone River\n05:36 North Fork Yellowstone River\n10:44 Day 4\n16:09 Thorofare Creek\n19:31 Storms in Thorofare Creek\n24:05 Day 5\n25:58 Open Creek\n31:18 Day 6\n34:20 Meadows and waterfalls\n37:26 Climbing unnamed pass\n42:35 Below Overlook Mountain\n51:30 Rampart Creek\n55:52 Day 7, Bushwacking and River crossings\n1:00:12 On Trail again\n1:05:56 Day 8\n\n\n\n#yellowstonenationalpark #yellowstone #wildflowerbloom #glacierbasin #tetonwilderness #grandtetons #grizzlybears #elks  #yellowstonefalls #greateryellowstone #myownfrontier #norwegianxplorer #wyoming #bearsafety #ursac #REI #Cody #nationalparks #wildamerica #nationalgeographic #waterfalls #climbing #mountaineering #highroute #jacksonwyoming #backpacking #hiking #adventure #americathebeautiful #bestnationalparks #backpackingyellowstone #bestyellowstone",

A storm was expected in the evening, but the weather held through the day and made for some spectacular sights. The scenery on top of the mountain was like a winter wonderland, everything was covered in shiny beautiful ice crystals, glittering and reflecting in the sun. Make sure to watch the final ascent to the summit of the mountain where it is all captured in beautiful 4k resolution. Views from the top of San Gorgonio are stunning, with Mt San Jacinto, Mt Baldy, Joshua tree national park, Big Bear, the Mojave desert and many other peaks and places in plain sight. The summit of San Gorgonio Mountain sits at an elevation  of 11506 ft, or just over 3500 meters, and is the highest peak in SoCal.",

Since I am not able to get out there and record new videos because of Covid-19, I have spent time and enhanced the colors and stabilization of the previous two part videos and made it into one full and much better looking video.\n\nWe did Coyote Gulch, Crack in the Wall, Stevens Arch, Stevens Canyon, The Baker Trail, WaterPocket Fold, Cliff, Georges Camp Canyon, Escalante River, Ezra MC bench, Fools Canyon, Kings Bench and climbed out Jacob Hamblin arch to finish an epic loop. There had been no rain in over 100 days when we did the trip, so water was a main concern, there were also multiple 4+ and lower 5 class scrambles and climbs that where challenging with heavy packs. We used maps from National Geographic and Steve Allens Canyoneering 2 book for navigation, as well as the Alltrails app for gps location. Gear from Osprey, Arcteryx, La Sportiva, Fjallreven, REI, Marmot, Mountian Hardwear, Paria Outdoors, Bergans of Norway and MSR.

        "description": "North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii 07-Apr-2012\n\nConditions: Moderate-Strong 18-20mph winds with gusts up to 25mph\n\nSynopsis: The Ozone Firefly is a new wing design produced by Ozone. It only comes in one size: 16m. I had the chance to demo the wing at another launch, but conditions were light and I didn't get a long flight; however, I decided to order myself a wing. \n\nAfter ground handling the new wing for awhile at a grass field I recognized that it acts vastly different from Ozone's Bullet class wings. It is an \"unstable\" wing meaning that it is more susceptible to input. In short: it is more fun to fly, but more difficult to handle on the ground. \n\nDuring my initial launch & flight I found that, as I expected, the wing indeed took more skill to launch than a bullet class wing, but once in the air it excelled in its ability to turn & maneuver. The wing has excellent forward speed for a 16m & great glide performance compared to a bullet class wing. \n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned on this first flight is to never hook the wing for landing as it causes to wing to gain altitude at a low angle of attack and then surge towards the ground, after reaching an apex, very lightly loaded with no flare. I then heard from a reliable source that it is advisable to do a slow carving turn rather than a fast hook turn for the reasons listed above. \n\nAll in all I am happy thus far with the wing. I was very conservative during this initial flight, but I look forward to a slightly less windy day to take the Firefly up and unleash the wings true potential.\n\n-TK Hinshaw",

        "description": "This is the second day of a new adventure as I explore a wilderness area in search of natural resources and a good location to establish the new hut. I'm carrying with me some essential items that I made and a small amount of food to keep me going for several days. On this day I found some very important resources that will be essential for me to inhabit this region. Watch closely as I put to use these basic primitive tools. You may recognize some of them from past videos such as when I made my small clay cooking pot. This series will be ongoing to be sure to stay tuned for the next video.\n\n*Turn on captions to see subtitles in other languages.\n*Please subscribe and enable notifications.\n\nFollow Chad on Instagram @chadzuberofficial\nFollow Chad on facebook.com/chadzuber\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):\n\nWho films you?  \nMe. I travel alone, shoot, edit, upload, everything, all alone. On a few occasions I may be accompanied by a friend.\n\nHow many cameras do you use?\nUsually I use just one camera. When I have underwater scenes then I also use a GoPro camera. I get different angles by moving the camera around and repeating the action to create a more cinematic viewing experience for the audience.\n\nWhere is this place?\nIn order to protect the integrity of the natural landscape I prefer to be very vague about the locations I use. There are places that I used to visit that were so beautiful and untouched but the consequences of social media brought all kinds of people to visit and sadly some people do not respect nature and have badly damaged these places. Therefore I do not share locations.\n\nWhere did you get your sandals?\nI first started wearing sandals on outdoor adventures in February 2014. I’m so glad that I did because wearing these Luna Sandals has really helped strengthen my feet.

I have some weights that I use and also do a lot of bodyweight exercises. I also run and sometimes swim. I hike frequently to collect wild foods and to shoot these videos so I'm very active all the time.\n\nAre you vegan or vegetarian?\nI wish I could maintain my health on a primal diet that does not include animals but unfortunately that did not work well and I ended up with health problems as a result of those attempts. From my studies, observations of nature, and personal experience I have come to believe that the best diet for optimal human health is a primal diet (paleo). \n\nDo you get lonely when you’re alone?\nNo, I don’t get lonely. I’m actually so busy shooting video, taking photos and doing so many other things like making cordage, cooking, weaving, etc. that I really don’t have time to think about my lonely condition. Sometimes when something profound happens on an adventure I can’t wait to share it with people, but other than that I do not get lonely.\n\nHow many languages do you speak?\nMy first language is English but I also speak fluent Spanish and Portuguese. I also speak very little Russian. I may soon begin learning more languages.\n\nHow old are you?\nI was born in 1972. At the time of this video I was 48.\n\nWhere did you get the music in your videos?\nThis series is the first one that I am making all the music myself. I recently made a drum and maracas (rumba shaker). I am now using them to create the intro and ending music in my videos, but before in the past I have used royalty free music from several sources including YouTube. Sometimes I bought the music but usually it was free.\n\nMy equipment:\n\nCamera: Nikon D7500\nSound: Zoom H4N\nEditing: Final Cut Pro X on MacBook Air\nLocation: Parts Unknown",

        "description": "This recent trip around the sun (commonly known as year 2020) was an excellent opportunity for people around the world to return to basic skills of self-reliance, survival and bushcraft. This video is being released at the very last minute of 2020 and highlights many of the great adventures I had and new primitive skills that I practiced. It’s basically all of my videos this year condensed into one great video.\nWith the close of this year instead of saying “out with the old and in with the new” I’d rather embrace more of the old ways and traditions, and I hope you will too.\nI wish you all a wonderful and healthy future!\n\nFollow me on Facebook.com/chadzuber\nFollow me on Instagram @chadzuberofficial\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):\n\nWho films you?  \nI do. I travel alone, shoot, edit, upload, everything. \n\nHow many cameras do you use?\nUsually I use just one camera. When I have underwater scenes then I also use a GoPro camera. I get different angles by moving the camera around and repeating the action to create a more cinematic viewing experience for the audience.\n\nWhere is this place?\nIn order to protect the integrity of the natural landscape I prefer to be very vague about the locations I use. There are places that I used to visit that were so beautiful and untouched but the consequences of social media brought all kinds of people to visit and sadly some people do not respect nature and have badly damaged these places. Therefore I do not share exactly where I go.\n\nDo you workout?\nYes, I workout, but not in a gym. I have some weights that I use and also do a lot of bodyweight exercises. I also run and sometimes swim. I hike frequently do collect wild foods and to shoot these videos so I'm very active all the time.\n\nAre you vegan or vegetarian?\nI wish I could maintain my health on a primal diet that does not include animals but unfortunately that did not work and I ended up with health problems as a result of those attempts. From my studies, observations of nature, and personal experience I have come to believe that the best diet for optimal human health is a primal diet (paleo). \n\nDo you get lonely when you’re alone?\nNo, I don’t get lonely. I’m actually so busy shooting video, taking photos and doing so many other things like making cordage, cooking, weaving, etc. that I really don’t have time to think about my lonely condition. Sometimes when something profound happens on an adventure I can’t wait to share it with people, but other than that I do not get lonely.",

        "description": "Last week I posted the first video of my primitive cattail boat as I launched from the beach and managed to push the small bushcraft sea vessel through the waves and reach the calmness of the open ocean. This raft or kayak proved to be very stable and reliable on the water as I paddled around for about an hour. In this video, I take the same kayak out again but this time I’m bringing my fishing gear to practice some primitive ocean survival fishing techniques with an artificial lure and fresh bait. During this three and a half hour voyage I found myself among a school of dolphin and even had a visit by a sea lion. Once again the kayak performed very well and I am looking forward to even greater adventures at sea in the near future.\n\nPlease subscribe and enable notifications.\n\n** Enable captions in your language\n\nFollow Chad on Facebook.com/chadzuber\nFollow Chad on Instagram @zuberchad\n\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):\n\nWho films you?  \nI do.

Many people don’t know that the fruits of this palm are edible and can easily be used to make a fermented beverage. In this video I use primitive basket tools that I made to collect the queen palm fruit and then wash and prepare the fruits at a mountain stream then allow them to ferment for one week in my calabash bottle gourd.

        "description": "Be sure to watch the previous video where I show how I made the yarn from yucca, animal fur, and bird feathers: https://youtu.be/UDlEdO-y5qM\nI designed and made this pillow based on the natural materials I found in my area. I wasn’t sure that this primitive technique would actually work but I was pleasantly surprised that it did work, and it worked well to create a pillow that not only provides good comfort and neck support but is also a work of art to look at. The combination of different materials truly make it a one-of-a-kind art piece. This video details exactly how you can make your own pillow from 100% natural materials from start to finish and I even include visual diagrams to help explain the process. This technique is my own creation and there are probably better ways to make a similar pillow so please add suggestions in the comments.

When I have underwater scenes then I also use a GoPro camera. I get different angles by moving the camera around and repeating the action to create a more cinematic viewing experience for the audience.\n\nWhere is this place?\nIn order to protect the integrity of the natural landscape I prefer to be very vague about the locations I use. There are places that I used to visit that were so beautiful and untouched but the consequences of social media brought all kinds of people to visit and sadly some people do not respect nature and have badly damaged these places. Therefore I do not share locations.\n\nWhere did you get your sandals?\nI first started wearing sandals on outdoor adventures in February 2014. I’m so glad that I did because wearing these Luna Sandals has really helped strengthen my feet. You can see their selection of adventure and running sandals at this link: https://www.lunasandals.com/?rfsn=102280.45562&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=102280.45562\n(Note: I receive an affiliate commission from any sales derived from clicking on the link above)\n\nDo you workout?\nYes, I workout, but not in a gym. I have some weights that I use and also do a lot of bodyweight exercises. I also run and sometimes swim. I hike frequently to collect wild foods and to shoot these videos so I'm very active all the time.\n\nAre you vegan or vegetarian?\nI wish I could maintain my health on a primal diet that does not include animals but unfortunately that did not work well and I ended up with health problems as a result of those attempts. From my studies, observations of nature, and personal experience I have come to believe that the best diet for optimal human health is a primal diet (paleo). \n\nDo you get lonely when you’re alone?\nNo, I don’t get lonely. I’m actually so busy shooting video, taking photos and doing so many other things like making cordage, cooking, weaving, etc. that I really don’t have time to think about my lonely condition. Sometimes when something profound happens on an adventure I can’t wait to share it with people, but other than that I do not get lonely.\n\nHow many languages do you speak?\nMy first language is English but I also speak fluent Spanish and Portuguese. I also speak very little Russian. I may soon begin learning more languages.\n\nHow old are you?\nI was born in 1972. At the time of this video I was 48.\n\nWhere did you get the music in your videos?\nThis series is the first one that I am making all the music myself. I recently made a drum and maracas (rumba shaker). I am now using them to create the intro and ending music in my videos, but before in the past I have used royalty free music from several sources including YouTube. Sometimes I bought the music but usually it was free.",

        "description": "After a very cold winter I realized the importance of having a reliable and effective heating source for my adobe hut. Now that the rains are over I can proceed making adobe bricks which I will use to build the walls of the fireplace that will be adjoined to the hut. I spent a lot of time considering how I would accomplish this. I estimate that I will need about 70 bricks to complete the project. It will take me approximately 18 hours of labor to make all the bricks. Then the actual construction will be the easy part. I chose the location of the fireplace to be in the back of the hut that way the hut can be heated from the rocket stove at the front as well as the fireplace in the back. Breaking through the wall was much more difficult than I imagined. The adobe bricks are very tough.\n\nFollow me on Facebook.com/PrimitiveSurvivalAdventure\nFollow me on Facebook.com/chadzuber\nFollow me on Instagram @zuberchad\n\nCamera: Nikon D7200\nSound: Zoom H4N\nEditing: Final Cut Pro X on MacBook Air\nLocation: southern California, USA\n\nMusic credits: \n\nDrums of the Deep by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400021\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

        "description": "I often make small items out of clay, sometimes I test the clay from a different location, sometimes I make a piece that is both artistic and functional. In this video I fire three small pieces in the adobe rocket stove and then prepare a hot tea made of a local medicinal plant called sticky monkey flower. Two of the clay pieces are just a test of clay found somewhere else but the third piece is made of clay found by the hut and sculpted like a turtle with five holes to hold cattail torches.

A cross draft kiln is one in which the flames travel from the firebox and across a horizontal wear chamber before traveling vertically up a chimney and out of the kiln. Unlike an updraft kiln there is no perforated floor that the pottery sits on. Instead the pot sits on the floor of the wearchamber as the flames pass around it. \nTaking soil from a previous kiln and mixing it into mud, I formed the kiln so it was less than a meter long. It was 25 cm wide and tall inside the tunnel formed by the kiln though a slight curve was added to the tops of the side walls. The walls were covered with sticks and a roof of mud was put in place onto this. A chimney about 25 cm wide and 65 cm in total height was made at the end of the kiln to draw flames through the kiln due to natural draft. 5 grate bars made of clay were installed in the firebox to make combustion more efficient. A side door was cut into the kiln to access the ware chamber (25 x 25 cm).\nClay was taken from the creek bank and mixed with previous crushed pottery as grog. It was formed into a pot with a pouring spout. This was dried and then placed into the kiln. The kiln was fired with the flames acting as planned and the pot was fired in a relatively short 1 hour and 20 minutes. It would have been a shorter firing time had the kiln not still been wet. The pot was tested with water and held it satisfactorily. \nCross draft kilns are an apparent improvement on updrafts with the reasoning being that more efficiently retain heat as the hot gasses don't immediately exit the kiln leaving the colder gasses inside. Hot spots are less likely to develop giving a more uniform firing of the pottery. Cross draft kilns developed early in Asia, evolving from the practice of excating tunnels into the side of hills to fire pottery. It's unknown whether the European cross drafts were adopted from the east or were the result of the gradual extension of the firing arch outwards from the conventional updrafts. My personal experience is that this type of kiln fires quickly and evenly though I need to experiment more to understand the positive and negative aspects more fully.\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

        "description": "This is an old hut I built 2 years ago and have since demolished. It was a 2 m square floor with wattle and daub walls 1.5 m high topped with a pyramidal roof thatched with Alexander palm fronds. The building method is my usual plan- get a roof up first then build the walls. From start to finish it took 27 days (it could have been faster though- this was at a casual speed). This was the first wattle and daub hut I built and is larger than the other one I built later (my idea for now is to build small but well although I'll try larger huts again in future). \n\nThe roof lasted for a few months before becoming rotten and bug eaten. As an important note the species of palm used in thatching makes all the difference. Had this hut been built in the mountain with wait-a-while palm fronds it would have lasted 2 years at least. \nInstead it was thatched with alexander palm fronds that deteriorated quickly.\n\n I wasn't to know this and was trying to adapt hut building practice I learned in the mountain to low land conditions (I've built similar huts up the mountain with the same roof shape that have lasted a long time). I hope in future videos to explore better roofing options to use in  areas like this.\n\n Also of interest in the video is another pot I make showing more detail than previous videos. The fire place for the hut is a simple pit in the center of the floor. It is a good hut design though it requires a simple ladder to construct.\nPrimitive Technology Blog: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress...\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&ty=h\nI have no face book page.

        "description": "I built a fenced enclosure and cultivated sweet potatoes (from civilisation) and yams (from the wild) in it. I originally had a small 3X3 m garden behind the wattle and daub hut that already had some sweet potato and yam vines growing in it that were planted after the hut was built. But wallabies kept eating the leaves. So I made a wattle enclosure around it to keep them out.  Wood ash was added to the soil to provide potassium and phosphorus for the growing tubers. \nThe previous small garden was organised in rows (not seen in this video) but this was hard to water during dry weather. So I re-organised the patch into 1 meter wide mounds with pits in the centre. Vines were planted into the mounds and water poured into the centre of each mound watered the vines. So then I had a small garden with 9 mounds contained within it. I decided to enlarge the patch to fit in more mounds so I took out 2 sides of the fence and extended them by a meter each. So the patch ended up being 4X4m and contained 16 mounds. In addition to wood ash, leaf mould was added to the mounds for fertility and to reduce loss of moisture.\nThe patch, being in the dark forest understory, received only about 2-3 hours of direct sunlight per day so the yield was disappointingly small. Nevertheless, the patch produced a few small sweet potatoes and a single larger yam. I also picked some green growing tips of the sweet potato vine that can also be eaten. I boiled the greens slightly in a pot with a hot stone and ate the leaves. I then roasted the sweet potatoes and yam in the coals of the fire. The sweet potatoes (purple fleshed tuber) taste sweet and starchy whereas the yam (white fleshed tuber) tastes similar to an ordinary potato. After eating, I took the wood ash from the fire and poured it back into the mounds that were harvested, replanted them and watered them. In future I’d plant the sweet potatoes in an area that receives much more sunlight in order to dramatically increase production. I’ve grown the same variety at home and it produces a much greater quantity and size of tubers in full sun. Wood ash also tends to increase tuber yield and so is a good use for waste ash.\nThe sweet potato is a remarkable plant. It’s a staple food of many traditional cultures. NASA has considered it a potential crop to be grown on spaceships for long term missions. In terms of energy production it’s only 3rd behind sugar cane and cassava. It produces the most food value (a combination of edible energy and nutrition) of any crop per unit space and time. A study of Fijian farms using manual labour showed that ratio of energy put into farming vs yield of energy was 1:17 for rice and 1:60 for sweet potato.  It grows on marginal soil and doesn’t require much nitrogen to grow. It takes a relatively short growth period of 3-4 months to yield. All parts of the plant can be eaten including the leaves which provide additional protein and nutrients.  I grow the purple variety (because it tastes better in my opinion) but all varieties are nutritious and will stave off malnutrition. A person could potentially be nearly self-sufficient from a small plot of sweet potatoes. Note that in colder climates, regular potatoes could be grown instead of sweet potatoes.\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&ty=h\nI have no face book page.

So after some procrastination, I decided on a low roof design. A 2.5 m by 2.5 m hut with a ridge 2 m above the ground and side walls 75 cm high. Upright posts were put in at about 60 cm intervals along the 3 walls. The front was left open  as this is more of an open workshop than a dwelling.  Grass was collected from high up in the hill as it will not grow in the darker, lowland forest. Carrying the thatch to the hut was the most labor intensive part taking approximately 36 hours over the course of more than a week.  The walls were then coated in soft, grey mud from a nearby clearing. The floor was coated in the same material. A large amount of rain fell due to a nearby tropical cyclone passing to the north. Despite this there were only a few leaks (mainly on the ridge line) that were subsequently patched with more grass. A fire was then lit with fire-sticks despite the damp conditions. This was done to help dry the mud walls and floor. The end of the video shows the yam mounds behind the hut doing well from of the torrential rain. The shelter will suffice for the remaining two months of rain that is expected to fall.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials.

I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials.

        "description": "(Turn on captions [CC] in the lower right corner for more information while viewing.)\nI made a brick mold that makes bricks 25 x 12.5 x 7.5 cm from wood. A log was split and mortise and tenon joints were carved using a stone chisel and sharp rocks. The mold was lashed together with cane to prevent it from coming apart when used. \n\nNext, I made a mixture of mud and palm fiber to make the bricks. This was then placed into the mold to be shaped and taken to a drying area. 140 bricks were made.\nWhen dry, the bricks were then assembled into a kiln. 32 roof tiles were then made of mud and fired in the kiln. It only took 3 hours to fire the tiles sufficiently. The mud bricks and tiles were a bit weaker than objects made from my regular clay source because of the silt, sand and gravel content of the soil. Because of this, I will look at refining mud into clay in future projects instead of just using mud.\n\nInterestingly, the kiln got hot enough so that iron oxide containing stones began to melt out of the tiles. This is not metallic iron, but only slag (iron oxide and silica) and the temperature was probably not very high, but only enough to slowly melt or soften the stones when heated for 3 hours.\n\nThe kiln performed as well as the monolithic ones I've built in the past and has a good volume. It can also be taken down and transported to other areas. But the bricks are very brittle and next time I'd use better clay devoid of sand/silt, and use grog instead of temper made of plant fiber which burns out in firing. The mold works satisfactorily. I aim to make better quality bricks for use in furnaces and buildings in future.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.",

        "description": "I made a blower and some charcoal at the new area in order to create higher temperatures in for advancing my material technology. I took Fan palm leaves and fashioned them into an impellor (about 25 cm in diameter) held in a split stick as a rotor. I then built a housing from clay (slightly more than 25 cm diameter with inlet and outlet openings about 8cm in diameter) and assembled the blower. I opted not to make a bow or cord mechanism as I’ve done before due to the complexity and lower portability of such a device. The lighter impellor material (leaf instead of the previous bark) made it easier to spin by hand anyway as it has a lower momentum. Each stroke of the spindle with the hand produces 4 rotations, so about 2 strokes per second gives 480 rpm. The blower increases the heat of a fire when blowing into it and I would guess it’s more effective than a blow pipe and lungs but don’t how it would compare to a primitive pot or bag bellows for air supply. A small furnace was made and then fired with wood fuel. The wood was wet but managed to fuse and partially met sand in the furnace. \nTo get better performance, I made charcoal from the poor quality wood. I made a reusable charcoal retort to make it. This was different from the previous reusable mound I built as it consisted of a mud cylinder with air holes around the base. To use, it was stacked with wood and the top was covered with mud as opposed to the previous design which had a side door. The fire was lit from the top as usual and when the fire reached the air entries at the base (after an hour or two) the holes were sealed and the mound left to cool. The top was the broken open the next day and the charcoal removed. Another batch was made using significantly less effort as the main structure of the mound did not need to be rebuilt each time, only the top.\nIron bacteria was again used to test the furnace. Charcoal and ore was placed in the furnace and the blower utilised. After an hour of operation the furnace was left to cool. The next day the furnace was opened and only slag was found with no metallic iron this time. I think increasing the ratio of charcoal to ore might increase the temperature so that the slag flows better. Further experiments will be needed before I get used to the new materials here.\nThe new area I’m in is significantly wetter than the old area and this has affected the order in which I create my pyro technology. The old spot was a dry eucalypt forest with an abundant source of energy dense fire wood. As a result, I developed kilns early on, powered with wood fuel and a natural draft, before developing charcoal fuelled forced air furnaces. In contrast, the new area is a wet tropical rainforest, where wood rots nearly as soon as it falls off the tree in the damp conditions. Wood is also more difficult to collect here because of hordes of mosquitoes (away from the fire) and unpleasant, spiky plants. Because of this I developed a forge blower first as it allows higher temperatures from a lower quantity and quality of fuel. \nThis poor quality wood can further be improved by converting it to charcoal first. In future, it may be necessary to cut fire wood green and dry it as opposed to picking it up off the ground dead as was preferable in the Eucalyptus forest I came from. The blower is also handy for stoking a tired campfire back into flames, I simply scrape the coals into a small mound around the nose of the tuyere and spin the impellor. I use the blower each day I’m at the hut for this purpose to save blowing on hot coals each time I need a fire for something. \nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.",

Polynesian arrow root is a plant in the same family as yams but with a different growth habit. It has a single, branching leaf and a single tuber below ground. They were brought to Australia about 5000 years ago as one of the \"canoe\" plants carried by Polynesian seafarers and grow wild in the hills near my hut to this day. The tubers are rich in starch but have a bitter compound that needs to be leached out with water to be made edible. This same compound is traditionally a medicine in small quantities for treating a range of illnesses from gastrointestinal upset to snake bite.  I dug up the tubers which took about 3 minutes to do per plant, yielding one golf ball sized tuber each. These were then washed and grated into a pot using a roof tile. The resulting mash was mixed with water and allowed to settle. The white milky water was then scooped into a second pot and the starch was allowed to settle. The water was then poured off and more starch water was tipped in. At this stage the starch was still bitter, so it was mixed with water, allowed to settle and the clear water above was poured off several times removing this bitterness. When it tasted good, the paste was put onto a tile to dry over a fire. Some of it cooked and became small rubbery pieces of starch. The dry flour was stored in a pot. Some of this was then mixed into a paste and cooked on a tile like a pancake. It turned clear when cooked and has a rubbery texture. It tasted just like a rice noodle which is unsurprising considering the ingredients are nearly the same. Starch is the largest carbohydrate in the human diet. Polynesian arrowroot starch contains 346 calories per 100 g (wheat contains 329) and so the discovery of this staple food is fairly significant. It can be stored indefinitely if kept dry and away from weevils or can be stored as live tubers for six months (then they begin to sprout and should be planted). The live tubers bitterness means animals will not eat them which is good for storage. I may cultivate some in a small plot in the hills near where I dug them up. They are numerous in the wild but may produce more if the soil is tilled.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

        "description": "Blower description \nThe purpose of this project was to test a simplified blower design connected to a furnace. I purposely did this to show that people in most natural environments should be able to replicate this design without difficulty. This blower differed from the previous one in several ways to simplify the construction method.\nFirstly, the impellor was simply a stick as a rotor with a 40 cm wide rectangle of bark tied into a split in its end with a bark fibre cordage. A stone with a pit carved into it acted as a socket for the lower half of the rotor to spin in. If spun in the dirt the rotor can drill down and the position of the impellor can reach ground level causing the blades to bump into rocks and dirt. Later, I plastered the stone socket into the ground with mud to hold it securely in position (not shown in the video, just be aware of this solution if the socket shifts around too much).\nSecondly, the housing for the blower was made in situ of ordinary mud (dirt and water on site). It was a bit more than 40 cm in internal diameter. The walls of the housing were solid mud and the roof was made of sticks covered with mud. An opening more than half the length of the impellor was left in the roof to remove the impellor for maintenance and to admit air into the blower during operation. In use, the portion of this opening near the front of the blower was covered with a tile. If left opened the blower still worked but covering it improved performance by preventing air escaping near the front. In places where water is not available, a housing shaped pit covered with sticks and dirt might work instead.\nFinally, a simple length of cordage was used to drive the rotation of the impellor. This cord was placed in a notch carved into the top of the impellor rotor. The cord was wrapped around the rotor about 2.5 times. During operation the cords were pulled outwards causing the rotation. When fully unwound, the momentum of the impellor then wrapped the cord back around in the other direction. Then the cords were pulled outwards again causing the impellor to spin in the other direction. Note that this is a centrifugal blower with a symmetrical housing, therefore it doesn’t matter whether the fan spins one way or the other (clockwise or anti clockwise), the blower will always suck air in to its open top and force it into the furnace. \nThis design is easy to make and use. It can be made with minimal materials by unskilled people. The impellor design is simple yet effective. A stick, some bark and lashing of some sort should be available in most areas. The housing being made from mud, is easily sourced also. For the drive mechanism, I chose this method because the first blower I built had too many parts. There was a frame made of wood and vine to hold the rotor in place which kept causing issues with the rotor seizing or jumping out of the socket. Also, the bow that was used to drive the rotor added unnecessary complexity. In the new design, the simple cord in the notch of the rotor did away with the frame and the bow of the old design and the associated difficulties. \nFurnace experiments\nThe blower was used to power a furnace attached to the front of it. Note that with minimal materials, the blower could simply force air into a hole in the base of the furnace and work satisfactorily. But I wanted to test a different configuration so I used clay grate from a previous kiln I made. Fuel in the form of wood and charcoal was used in this furnace by being placed on top of the grate instead of under it. During operation, the blower forced air up through the grate into the burning fuel bed increasing the rate of heat production relative to the use of natural draft (convection) alone. \nI made 3 pots and fired them with charcoal. The first pot was painted with iron bacteria (iron oxide being the active ingredient). When fired, the oxide melted slightly showing minimal glazing. The clay became quite hard, possibly stoneware. The second pot was painted with wood ash and placed on a three sided clay plinth to hold the pot in the position of highest temperature in the fuel bed. The pot softened and sagged apart catastrophically. But the ash glaze gave a dark green smooth finish (difficult to see in the video). Finally, a pot was place upside down on the grate and a cylindrical brick made of iron bacteria, charcoal powder and wood ash was put on top of this. The brick melted over the pot, covering it in a viscous blob of slag rather than a thin glaze. On inspection, the slag had 1mm sized spheres of metallic iron in it. Some of these were picked out and stored in a pot. The reason for experiments like these to gain knowledge that might be of practical use in future projects that have not yet been determined.\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.",

        "description": "The manufacture of a stone ax including the handle from using  only primitive tools and materials. It is a celt (pronounced \"selt\") a type of ax with a polished stone head wedged into a hole or mortise at the end of a wooden handle (not to be confused with a \"Kelt\" referring to a Celtic person). The head took about a week and a day to make as I chose to make it from a particularly large piece of basalt. The hammer stone used to shape the basalt was of quartz. This involved hammering, pecking, grinding and polishing the head into the final shape. The handle took a day and a morning to make. A chisel was made from stone and a mallet made from a log. These were used to cut the tree for the handle and shape it once down. Fire was used to harden the wood and also to help shape the mortise. The ax was then used to cut down a tree the day after the handle was a tree itself. It is a more efficient tool for felling trees than the hand ax I made and at the time of uploading this video has cut down 4 trees which I will use later. Because this stone axe is blunter than a steel one, the blade needs to hit the tree at angles greater than 45 degrees- otherwise the blade would glance off. So celts were used more like wedges than modern axes.\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&ty=h\nI have no face book page.

        "description": "In this video I build a garden to grow Cassava and yams, two staple food crops. Cassava is a shrub that develops large edible roots. Yams are a climbing vine that produce large, edible underground bulbs and smaller aerial bulbs on their vines. \nI had 5 huts, but the wattle and daub hut (from the first video uploaded on this channel nearly 2 years ago) became dilapidated. I abandoned it in favour of the other huts I built and neglected the roof. This let water in destroying a wall. Also, the sweet potato patch behind it had a tree fall across it destroying the fence. So I demolished them both to make one large garden.\nAfter removing the fence I set a fire under the fallen tree to burn it in half rather than spend the effort of cutting it with stone tools. After burning almost all the way through, it rained. So I came back later and cut through the rest of the log with stone tools. I eventually broke the tree in half. Using smaller logs as levers I moved the tree out of the garden clearing the space for the garden.\nI then collected wood and built a simple fence that was woven loosely together with vine. The fence needs only to discourage large animals from entering to prevent them causing damage. Most times pigs and wallabies don’t know that food is growing in the garden and won’t try and enter if they see no reason to. Or at least that worked for the sweet potatoes so we’ll see if it works this time.\nFor the yam and cassava planting material I travelled far down stream to the site of my old stone hut that I built over 10 years ago. It had a corbelled dome roof that was damaged when a tree fell on it during a cyclone and it came down a few months later. The thick walls however have stayed standing for about a decade though. \nYams and cassava grew wild at this site which is one of the reasons I built the stone hut there. These plants are not native to Australia but grow wild here after having escaped from people’s gardens (similar to how wild pigs live here now after escaping from farms). The planting material for the yams are the bulbs that grow on the vines. The planting material for cassava are simply 25 cm long pieces of stem.\nOn returning to the garden, a scrub turkey was seen digging in the mounds. Protected by law, this bird has lost its fear of humans and in this case I’ve semi-domesticated it. Originally it was attracted to soil I dug up for the worms it exposed. I started leaving a pot out with small sweet potatoes in it for it to eat and now it investigates any pottery I leave for food. Now it visits my projects and will only leave if bored or chased away. I suppose this is similar to how chickens were domesticated, in fact bush turkeys and chickens are related and will produce hybrid offspring. \n Unfortunately, it has learned that the garden contains food. Originally, I was only going to plant yams but I saw the turkey digging them up and eating them. So, I planted cassava in the mounds so that the turkey would be discouraged by finding only wooden stems to peck at. I secretly planted the yams along the fence of the garden because the turkey only thinks the mounds contain yams. They can’t smell very well and only find food by sight and learned behavior. \nI planted the cassava in mounds 1 meter apart by pushing them flat into the soil. I planted the yams at intervals along the fence so they could use it as a trellis. 32 cassava stems and 12 yams were planted. Then a storm began and watered the garden. In less than a week the cassava had sprouted shoots and began to grow. The yams will take longer as I planted them deeper.\nCassava produces the most calories per time and space of any plant apart from sugar cane and sugar beet. But it requires much less fertiliser and effort. A hectare of cassava produces enough calories in 2 days to sustain a person for 1 year. It takes a year to come to harvest but will stay in the ground for a year without becoming woody. The tubers are high in starch and are what tapioca is made from. \nThis variety is called sweet cassava (actually not bitter cassava, it doesn’t taste sweet but starchy instead) and it needs to be boiled for 20 minutes to get rid of some cyanide it contains. The bitter variety contains such high levels that it kills if eaten raw and requires more extensive treatment to eat. There isn’t much nutrition in cassava other than the large amount calories it contains so other food would be required to provide protein and nutrients.  \nAfter I harvest the cassava I planted I’ll try fermenting it (which adds nutrition), drying it and pounding it into flour to make flat bread. Cassava flour has the same energy content as wheat flour, stores well and tastes somewhat similar. Or I could just cook it and eat it straight from the garden. I’ll use the yams like potatoes when they’re ready.",

        "description": "I made a batch of charcoal using the mound method then stored it in baskets for later use. Charcoal is a fuel that burns hotter than the wood it's made from. This is because the initial energy consuming steps of combustion have taken place while making the charcoal driving off the volatile components of the wood (such as water and sap). The result is a nearly pure carbon fuel that burns hotter than wood without smoke and with less flame. Charcoal was primarily a metallurgical fuel in ancient times but was sometimes used for cooking too. \n\nTo make the charcoal the wood was broken up and stacked in to a mound with the largest pieces in the center and smaller sticks and leaves on the out side. The mound was coated in mud and a hole was left in the top while 8 smaller air holes were made around the base of the mound. A fire was kindled in the top of the mound using hot coals from the fire and the burning process began (the hot coals are being poured in the top using a small pot at 2:38).\n\nThe fire burned down the inside of the mound against the updraft. I reason that this is a better way to make charcoal as the rising flames have used up the oxygen and prevent the charcoal already made above them from burning while driving out even more volatiles .\n\nI watched the air holes at the base of the mound and when the fire had burned right up to each opening I plugged them with mud. Once all 8 holes had be sealed the hole in the top of the mound was sealed with mud and the mound left to cool. From lighting the mound to closing up the holes the whole process took about 4 hours.\n\nThe next day when the mound was cool to the touch (this can take about 2 days sometimes) I opened the mound. The resulting charcoal was good quality. Some wood near the air entries had burned to ash though these were only small twigs and leaves. This is the reason small brush is put on the out side of the mound, to be burned preferentially to the larger wood on the inside thus protecting the large pieces of charcoal.\n\nThe charcoal that was made was hard and shiny. When broken open it had the ray structure of the wood preserved. When moving the hand through it the charcoal sounded tinny, like coral on a beach being moved by waves. These are signs of good quality. Bad charcoal is soft, breaks easily and has a muffled sound. \n\nI intend to use the charcoal to produce hotter fires than I'm able to with wood alone. From my research, a natural draft furnace using wood (a kiln) can reach a maximum of 1400 c degrees whereas a natural draft furnace using charcoal can reach 1600 c degrees. Achieving high temperatures is necessary for changing material to obtain better technology (e.g. smelting ore into metal).\n\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&ty=h\nI have no face book page.

        "description": "I built a round hut using palm thatch and mud walls to replace the damaged A-frame hut built a few months ago. The A frame hut was damaged due to torrential rain and poor design elements considering the wet conditions. The thatch had rotted in the part of the roof that gets shade. Moth larvae and mold grew and consumed the thatch in these places. The hut also tilted forward due to the back post being hammered in only 25 cm into the ground. So on returning to the property (it was cut off by flooded bridge) I began work on a new hut.\nThe new hut was positioned further into the open clearing to get more sunlight. A 3 meter diameter circle was scribed and 12 wooden posts were hammered into the ground, each 50 cm deep for a sturdier structure. Lintels were then tied to the top of the posts joining the posts together. A tripod ladder was made from poles lashed together at the top and a platform lashed to its frame. The roof poles were then attached to the top of the lintels and lashed together at the top to form a conical roof frame, 3 meters at the highest point. Loya cane was then tied on the eaves to act as support for the ends of the palm thatch. \n700 palm fronds were then cut split and thatched onto the roof. The tripod ladder was used to climb up and thatch the roof from the inside. A cap was then made to put on the very top of the cone when the roof was almost finished.\nA drainage moat was dug around the hut and the excavated soil was placed on the hut floor to raise its level above the damp ground. A deluge tested the hut’s water shedding abilities. Torrential rain fell while a fire was kept going inside the dry hut. The drainage moat flowed like a stream during the heavy rain event. \nLoya cane was then harvested and woven between the posts. This formed a low wall. It was then daubed with mud inside and out. The clay from this was taken from the drainage moat. Rain falling into the moat meant that water didn’t need to be collected from the stream to mix the mud. This is another benefit of the drainage moat.\nThe low wall allows light and air into the hut. With a fire going in the central pit, mosquitoes are kept at bay. The central fire pit produces smoke and heat that will hopefully prevent moths laying eggs in the roof (the caterpillars of which eat thatch) and will prevent mold from growing. The hut will be used as an undercover work space for future projects.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.",

We use the stone ax to cut bamboo, use bark to wire, we tighten the bamboo tube by the primitive technology. That is very difficult. We had to go deep into the forest to perform primitive skill. We did at a stream in the forest. I'm sure it's a good primitive technology video.

No bears or anything dangerous for campers.\n\n_________________\n\nMost asked questions:  \n\n1. Did you do fishing?\nYes - off camera did I get the net in the water and caught a few fish. Unfortunately was it very bad video production weather most of the time and was unable to record any of the fishing. I will do a lot more fishing in fure videos. \n\n2. Was the water safe to drink? \nYes. The sea is salt water and not safe to drink. The water I am drinking is fresh water coming from the underground - it is some of the most ideal water sources. \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used in the video:\n1.

Clean and remote classic northern wilderness. Fresh water rivers. Pine, spruce and birch forrest. Mountains, bears, wolves, eagles, reindeers etc. No wildlife is giving campers problems. I can't give you any information about my location, only that I am somewhere in Sapmi. Location: Sapmi - the land of the Sami people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Clean and remote classic northern wilderness. Fresh water rivers. Pine, spruce and birch forrest. Mountains, bears, wolves, eagles, reindeers etc. No wildlife is giving campers problems. I can't give you any information about my location, only that I am somewhere in Sapmi. You need to be the owner or get the owners permission if you want to do the same.  \n\nConsuming: Water (meltwater) and fish (pike).\n\n_________________\n\nA few questions:  \n\n1. How did you make the tinder?\nBy boiling the \"amadou\" layer from the \"tinder fungus\" in about 50/50% wood ashes and water for about 1 hour. Amadou is a layer next to the outside hard shell on the fungus. All hard wood ashes can be used, but birch ashes should be some of the most ideal. You can cut off the amadou or you can, like I do in the video, make the fungus softer by boiling and separate it by hitting and or pulling. You can use green or dry tinder fungus - just try to avoid the rotten once (the one I use in the video is close to be to rotten). I can't tell you why it works - but it makes the amadou a hundred times easier to use for fire lightning. In my area of the word have tinder fungus been used as the main tinder long before the viking age and way after the vikings. The tinder I made in the video will be enough for lighting a few hundred campfires. \"Tinder fungus\" is a specific fungus growing on hardwood trees and very common in my part of the world. other names for the fungus is \"Horse's Hoof Fungus\", \"Fomes fomentarius\" and \"Hoof Fungus\".  \n\n2. Is the water safe to drink? \nYes. Almost all water in Sapmi can you drink straight from the source. All from remote locations. It comes from the near by mountains - meltwater.   \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used:\n1. Pants = Klattermusen Gere 2.0 Regular\n2. Boots = Redback original\n3.

So it is all about doing some homework and getting to know a lot of mushrooms - looks, smell, taste, structure, common habitat etc. I have been on a few trips with an expert teaching me the basics a few years ago... I can recommend all to do the same, it is a lot better than books, but books is also a great tool.

It's often internationally referred to as a \"puukko knife\" and not just \"puukko\" even though you can argue that \"puukko knife\" means if translated \"knife knife\".

Why make the fire place so big?\nI will mainly be using this shelter doing winter and need a big fire so it can burn most of the night giving me a more comfortable sleep. It also offers \"table\" place. A low wall of stones is added and it will block some wind and reflect some more heat towards the shelter. Ideally would the wall be a lot taller, but choose not to as a compromise so the viewers still are able to see the fire from most of the camera angles. \n\n2. Is the wood storage waterproof? \nNo. It is only meant to provide very basic covering from the first few snowfalls - after that will snow create walls and shelter the firewood ideally. Near by is quite a few dead standing pine trees and I will just cut down what I think I need each time I visit the camp until the snow provide ideal shelter for the wood storage.\n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used:\n1.

Who is Morten Hilmer?\nA nature photographer from Denmark and a dear friend of mine. Morten is specialised in Arctic and Nordic wildlife. I am currently living together with Morten on his farm in Northern Jutland. Morten has filmed some of the footage in this video. \n\n2. What kind of bread were you baking? \nIn Danish is it called \"snobrød\" which can be translated into \"twisted bread\". It is a very common method in Denmark. Some of the benefits of \"snobrød\" is that you can watch the bread during the baking process to make sure nothing gets overbaked and the simplicity of not needing any cooking gear. \"Snobrød\" is also very quick to bake, only about 15 minutes.      \n \n3. Did you catch any fish?\nNo. Pike was the goal, but no luck.  \n\n4. It has been a year since your last video... What have you been up to?\nSorry. I have spent the time learning more craft - mainly log cabin building and old constructions of forge welded axes. \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used in the video:\n1.

        "description": "I am enjoying a few days in the forrest. Trying a new tent and a homemade billhook. It's late winter here in Denmark and it's about -1 to +8 celcius. I am doing craft and enjoying some great food. This is the long version - here is the short version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-quwSgnXbn0 \n\n--------------------------------\n\nLocation: Denmark - previous viking country. West coast of Jutland - sand, big sea, spruce and pine forrest. Some of the most remote in Denmark, but a lot of people in Denmark so limited how remote it can get. A lot of birds and deer. No bears only a few wolves - nothing dangerous for campers. If you want to do the same in Denmark do you need to be the owner or get the owners permission.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nHere can you see how I made the billhook/the big knife https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsGNC49jP4 \n\nHere can you see how I made the candle sticks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a1mt1Kvoa4 \n\nHere can you see how I made the saw frame https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl-_n2yM8c0&t=93s\n\nHere can you see how I made the drill/auger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmT9IDx3bIc&t=231s\n\n---------------------\n\nA few questions:\n\nWhat are you eating?\nCabbage, eggplant, beans, onions, tomatoes - with oregano, salt and \"English sauce\". I did forget the meat at home... never done that before, but it happened this time.\n\nWhat wood did you use for making the spoon?\nOak. \n\nWas it a branch you used for the rack bindings?\nYes - green branch from pine twisted into \"rope\". You can make most wood into \"rope\" like that. \n\nWhy add moss on the table?\nKeeps the sticks better in place and no small side branches can catch what ever you lay on the table or just fall though the tabletop. .\n\nWhy didn't you do a better job on sewing the sack?\nIt's an old one, over 20 years old and the material is not strong any more. I did just quickly, while cooking the food, prevent the big hole from getting bigger. I will replace the stitches when I get home and sew all the holes with nice straight stitches - or maybe just consider if it's time to replace the sack with a new one.\n\nDid you like the billhook?\nYes, it did a fine job and I will use it more in future videos.... But I do like axes better. Having both an axe and a billhook would be very useful in a camp like this. \n\nIs it a Sami sewing kit?\nYes - homemade. \n\nWhat is that background noise?\nOnly nature sounds - I am about one mile from a big sea and that sounds sometimes similar to a highway. The rest is just wind. \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used in the video:\n1. Sweaters = unknown. \n2. Pot and kettle = made by \"eagle\" 1.5 and 10 liters. \n3. Pants = made by \"Ridgeline\"\n4. Billhook = homemade. \n5. Carving tools = homemade axe, mora 106, Pfeil 8L 25mm and 7A 25mm \n6. Boots = made by \"Redback\" original boots\n7. Tent = made by \"Savotta\" 4P\n8. Backpack = made by \"Fjallraven\" Kajka 65L\n9. Sharpening stone = made by \"Gransfors Bruks\" \n10. Stove = mass production from Russia \"Poshehonka\"\n\n_________________\n\nVideo gear: Nikon D7000, Nikon 50 1.8, Røde videomacro, iMovie.  \n\n_________________",

        "description": "I set up a blacksmith shop, do a walkabout in the area, use the raft, catch fish and eat some of the dried fish from part 1. Open the full video description for more information. \n\nThis is part 3 and the short version - here is the long version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5r2rOjI8rw\n\nAll episodes can you see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUyDwdRkceQ&list=PLwMRed9dogc6GGAhEn1Aj66AOClYFRUl2\n\n----------------------------\n\nDate: 01-08-2019 to 02-08-2019\n\nDay: 20°C (68°F)\nNight: 10°C (50°F)\n\nLocation: Sapmi - the land of the Sami people in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Clean and remote classic northern wilderness. Fresh water rivers. Pine, spruce and birch forrest. Mountains, bears, wolves, eagles, reindeers etc. No wildlife is giving campers problems. I can't give you any information about my location, only that I am somewhere in Sapmi. You need to be the owner or get the owners permission if you want to do the same.   \n\n_________________\n\nConsuming: Water, berries and fish (cranberry, blueberry, smoked and air dried perch).\n\n_________________\n\nA few questions: \n\n1. Is the blacksmithing tools homemade? \nYes - video on the channel about how I make tongs and how I made the anvil and the hammer. No video yet on how I make bellows, but it is a future video. If you want similar do I recommend you make it your self - but it is also an option to find secondhand or pay for custom work (I don't sell anything). Example can similar anvil be found online if you google \"stake anvil\" or \"stump anvil\" or \"viking anvil\" or similar.  \n\n2. Can you give a few points about the blacksmith shop set up?\nYes. The stones closest to the fire will need replacements once in a while. The branch used as rope on the anvil stump helps prevent it wood from spritting. Used a tree as a stump because it was convenient - the tree was located just right and dying (small trees so close to big tress always struggle). The wooden pegs keeps the bellows from moving and is easy to remove and use agin or replace. The goal is to keep the fire narrow so the air you blow don't need to travel far and the sides open so the forge fit long work pieces - but before you start forging can you move around the stones to custom fit the task. Make sure the bellows don't touch the fire, you don't wan't to heat up the steel tubes. Try to make it a habit always to use both bellows. Let one blow air and one suck air at the same time. The constant blow of air makes it harder for the other tube to suck in hot air and burn or dry the leather. Ideally does only the valve take in air and not the tube. Constant blow of air also just makes the forge more efficient.\n\n3. Is the water safe to drink? \nYes. Almost all water in Sapmi can you drink straight from the source. Especially all on remote locations. It comes from the near by mountains - rain or snow/ice melting. \n\n4. What fish did you catch?\nTrout. \n\n5. Why use a stick and not a paddle for the raft?\nA stick from the tipi was the easy solution and more ideal for pushing agains the bottom of the river... In the areas where the river is too deep will a paddle work beter - but just using a stick isn't too bad.\n\n6. How did you dry the fish?\nHung them up in the tipi as raw with nothing added, no salt or anything (show it in part 1) and left them where for about two weeks. Whenever I visit the camp did I light a fire inside the tipi for adding some smoke taste and soften the bones - but most of the time was I not in the camp and the fish did just dry in the air. The air in Sapmi is in general dry and it makes air drying meat really easy. \n\n7. Was it \"chaga\" you used to carry fire?\nYes. A fungus called \"Chaga\". I use it in other videos for making tea. In this case do I use it for transporting fire.The chaga was collected near by the tipi and was only dried a few hours next to the campfire. If you want to transport fire like this do I recommend bringing along a few spare pieces so you can replace it doing the travel. One piece lasted in this case about 30 minutes. If it starts glowing too much can you just scrape some of the glowing part away.  \n\n_________________\n\nSome of the gear used:\n1. Pants = Klattermusen Gere 2.0 Regular\n2.

In this bushcraft overnight trip I built a raised bed, a nice fire reflector, and established a really nice camp. It rained on and off but fire was no problem. It felt really nice to relax this trip, and was a huge difference to my survival video. Practicing some bushcraft skills was fun, and relaxing by the fire was very enjoyable too. While I shot this video, I happened to see a deer being chased through the woods by what I believe to be a dog. I also came across three deer bones, one of them had a full set of antlers. So I'm not sure what to say about that, or whether it was the dog I saw or cougars in the area. Regardless, I had an awesome time out there on this solo overnight bushcraft camp.

Look out for that one next week.\n\n\nZed Outdoors: https://www.youtube.com/user/ZedOutdoors\n\nScrambled O: https://www.youtube.com/user/ScrambledO\n\nCheers Dave\n\nDonations- https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HARZWWKK5RR4N\n\nMy Channel- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd9Q-GzcRtJJ0KSX4jAdbzQ\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBC Bushcraft, BCBushcraft, Bushcraft BC, Canadian Bushcraft, Bushcraft Canada, Canadian Bushcraft Channels, Bushcraft, Bush craft, Woodcraft, Wood craft, Survival, Solo overnight, Solo overnights, Wildcamp, Wild camp, Solo Survival, Primitive skills, DIY, Scout survival, Fishing, Knives, Bushcraft knives, Axes, Bushcraft axes, Fire, Bushcraft Skills, Survival skills, Bushcraft kit, Bushcraft gear, Gear, Gear reviews,  Shelter, Edc, Prepping, Peparedness, Preps, Hiking, Bushcraft Video, Bushcraft Videos, Crafts, Woodworking, Wood working, Knife making, Leather, Leather craft, Camping, Backpacking, LNT, Ultra light, Natural, Natural Tinder, Belt kit, DIYS, Canada, B.C.

This time out I did a across between a solo survival video and a solo overnight bushcraft camp. I went out in mind to build a different type of survival shelter then I have previously done, while also bringing along some gear and food. A minimal bushcraft trip with solo survival elements incorporated into it, this video kind of finds the grey area between both activities. I hope everyone finds this one an enjoyable watch.\nTake Care,\nDave\n\nDonations- https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HARZWWKK5RR4N\n\nBushcraft Heroes: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5t5bWuLldfphxeya39iGqA\n\nKnife- Real Steel Bushcraft Plus- http://www.realsteelknives.com/index.php/bushcraft-series/bushcraft-plus.html\n\nMy Channel- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd9Q-GzcRtJJ0KSX4jAdbzQ\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBC Bushcraft, BCBushcraft, Bushcraft BC, Canadian Bushcraft, Bushcraft Canada, Canadian Bushcraft Channels, Bushcraft, Bush craft, Woodcraft, Wood craft, Survival, Solo overnight, Solo overnights, Wildcamp, Wild camp, Solo Survival, Primitive skills, DIY, Scout survival, Fishing, Knives, Bushcraft knives, Axes, Bushcraft axes, Fire, Bushcraft Skills, Survival skills, Bushcraft kit, Bushcraft gear, Gear, Gear reviews,  Shelter, Edc, Prepping, Peparedness, Preps, Hiking, Bushcraft Video, Bushcraft Videos, Crafts, Woodworking, Wood working, Knife making, Leather, Leather craft, Camping, Backpacking, LNT, Ultra light, Natural, Natural Tinder, Belt kit, DIYS, Canada, B.C.

        "description": "U.S. Marines and Sailors conduct 24-hour flight operations in international airspace aboard the USS Wasp (LHD 1) in the Philippine Sea. Maritime prepositioning enables deployment flexibility and an increased capability to respond rapidly to a crisis or contingency with a credible presence. \n\nThe F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft. Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the vertical flight system. Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight. Jet thrust is sent directly downwards during vertical flight. \n\nVideo Credits: U.S. Marine Corps Motion Imagery by Cpl. Richard Limone\n\nThumbnail Credit: Sgt.

U.S. Marine and U.S. Army mortar teams conduct live-fire exercises with the M327, M1129 Mortar Carrier, Soltam K6 Mortars.\n\nMortier 120mm Rayé Tracté Modèle F1 or M327 - in service with the U.S. Marine Corps as the M327 120mm Expeditionary Fire Support System is a heavy mortar of French origin. It was designed by Thomson-Brandt as the successor to the MO-120 AM-50. The RT in the designator stands for rayé, tracté, which means rifled, towed.\n\nThe Soltam K6 is a 120 mm mortar that was developed by Soltam Systems of Israel. It is the long-range version of the Soltam K5 and has replaced older systems, such as the 107-millimetre (4.2 in) M30, in several armies including the United States Army. It is much lighter than the M30, has a greater range, and can sustain a rate of fire of four rounds per minute, while the M30 could sustain only three.\n\nThe M1129 Mortar Carrier, is an 8×8 wheeled armored mortar carrier of the Stryker family of combat vehicles produced by General Dynamics Land Systems. It is in use with the United States Army.\n\nThe M106A3 mortar carrier is self-propelled artillery vehicle in service with the United States Army.\n\nVideo Credits: U.S. Army & U.S. Marine Corps  |  United States Department of Defense\n\nThumbnail Credit: U.S. Army photo by Gertrud Zach\n\n►Subscribe Now  -- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4layPPCzgR_99g5VYYvmQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n►Know a second language?

Fire control is provided by a system from STN Atlas Elektronik with target tracking, fire control computation as well as gun control performed from a remote operator console. Sensors include a thermal imager, TV camera, laser range finder and automatic target tracking system with a video tracker.\n\nThis weapon was designed by Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH, a Rheinmetall DeTec subsidiary, to replace older 20 mm and 40 mm guns and the mounting does not require deck penetration. Can be operated remotely or locally with a joystick. 83 of these weapons have been ordered by the German Navy.\n\nThis weapon is a gas-operated automatic revolver cannon. Can be assembled for either left- or right-hand feed, and uses linkless ammunition with a case recovery system.\n\nWarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!

Thomas Williams (Ret.) fires the legendary M2 Flamethrower and tells you everything you ever wanted to know about its history in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nThe Flamethrower you see in this video is  the same flame thrower used in the movies \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" \"Letters from Iwo Jima,\" and \"Wind Talkers.\"\n\nThe M2 flamethrower was an American man-portable backpack flamethrower.\n\nIt was the successor to the M1 and M1A1 flamethrowers. Although its burn time was only around 7 seconds and the flame was only effective out to around 20–40 meters, it was still a useful weapon. However, with the arrival of flamethrower tanks, the need for flamethrower-carrying infantrymen to expose themselves to fire was greatly reduced.\n\nThough some M2s were sold off, the majority were scrapped when they were declared obsolete.\n\nWarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!

        "description": "Video footage shows Russian made combat helicopters in action during several miliary training exercises involving close air support filmed from several angles including GoPro cameras. Most helicopters shown in the video are the MIL MI-24 Hind & Kamow KA-52 Alligator.\n\nThe Mil Mi-24 (Russian: Миль Ми-24; NATO reporting name: Hind) is a large helicopter gunship, attack helicopter and low-capacity troop transport with room for eight passengers. It is produced by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and has been operated since 1972 by the Soviet Air Force and its successors, along with 48 other nations.\n\nIn NATO circles, the export versions, Mi-25 and Mi-35, are denoted with a letter suffix as \"Hind D\" and \"Hind E\". Soviet pilots called the Mi-24 the \"flying tank\" (летающий танк; letayushchiy tank), a term used historically with the famous World War II Soviet Il-2 Shturmovik armored ground attack aircraft. More common unofficial nicknames were \"Galina\" (or \"Galya\"), \"Crocodile\" (Крокодил; Krokodil), due to the helicopter's camouflage scheme and \"Drinking Glass\" (Стакан; Stakan), because of the flat glass plates that surround earlier Mi-24 variants' cockpits.\n\nKa-52 Alligator is an all-weather attack helicopter operated by the Russian Air Force. Developed by Kamov Design Bureau (part of Russian Helicopters), Ka-52 is a twin-seat variant of the Ka-50 attack helicopter.\n\nThe Ka-52 helicopter can destroy enemy armoured and unarmoured ground targets, low-speed aerial targets and personnel at the frontline and in tactical depth. It is also deployed as a surveillance platform and aerial command post for a group of attack helicopters.\n\nThe first Ka-52 helicopter was rolled out in December 1996. The helicopter completed its first flight in June 1997. The serial production of Ka-52 began in 2008 at Progress Arsenyev Aviation plant in the Primorye region of Russia.\n\nRussia plans to equip its proposed Mistral Class amphibious assault ships with Ka-52K helicopters. Ka-52K is a naval variant of the Ka-52 Alligator.\n\nCredits: Russian Ministry of Defence:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQGqX5Ndpm4snE0NTjyOJnA\n\nWarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!

        "description": "The war in Afghanistan is the period in which the United States invaded the country after the September 11 attacks, supported initially by close allies, and eventually by the wider North Atlantic Treaty Organization, beginning in 2003. The conflict is also known as the U.S. war in Afghanistan. It followed the Afghan Civil War's 1996–2001 phase. Its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda, and to deny it a safe base of operations in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power. Key allies supported the U.S. from the start, including the United Kingdom. In August 2003, NATO became involved as an alliance, taking the helm of the International Security Assistance Force. On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan and transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government, via a ceremony in Kabul.\nU.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda, bin Laden had already been wanted by the U.N. since 1999. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the U.S. as a meaningless delaying tactic and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance. The U.S. and its allies drove the Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.\nIn December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), to assist the Afghan interim authorities with securing Kabul. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\nIn 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries. NATO members provided the core of the force. One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct U.S. command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement, and in 2003, launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.\nThough vastly outgunned and outnumbered, the Taliban insurgents, most notably the Haqqani Network and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces. The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan. ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to \"clear and hold\" villages and \"nation building\" projects to \"win hearts and minds\".\nWhile ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan. In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The US military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders. This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.\nOn 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan. In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces. UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban. In May 2014, the United States announced that its combat operations would end in 2014, leaving just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016.\nAs of 2015, tens of thousands of people have been killed in the war. Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 15,000 Afghan national security forces members have been killed. In October 2014, British forces handed over the last bases in Helmand to the Afghan military, officially ending their combat operations in the war.",

On 27 May 2014, President Barack Obama announced that U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end in December 2014. A residual force of 9,800 troops would remain in the country, training Afghan security forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against remnants of al-Qaeda. This force would be halved by the end of 2015, and consolidated at Bagram Air Base and in Kabul. Obama also announced that all U.S. forces, with the exception of a \"normal embassy presence,\" would be removed from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. These plans were confirmed with the signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan on 30 September 2014.",

I will make a special video of the battle of the Donetsk airport.\nThe War in Donbass (also called the War in Ukraine or War in Eastern Ukraine) is an armed conflict in the Donbass region of Ukraine. From the beginning of March 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, together commonly called the \"Donbass\", in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Euromaidan movement. These demonstrations, which followed the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, and which were part of a wider group of concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an armed conflict between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the Ukrainian government. Prior to a change of the top leadership in August, the separatists were largely led by Russian citizens. During the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries were reported to make up between 15% and 80% of the combatants.",

The purpose of the tests was to examine how underwater explosions affected materiel, investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships, etc.\n\nThe Pacific Proving Grounds was the name given by the United States government to a number of sites in the Marshall Islands and a few other sites in the Pacific Ocean at which it conducted nuclear testing between 1946 and 1962. The U.S. tested a nuclear weapon (codenamed Able) on Bikini Atoll on 30 June 1946. This was followed by Baker on July 24, 1946.",

        "description": "As pastured poultry producers we face a challenge that conventional growers don't have to deal with, Mother Nature. She doesn't always agree with your plans and that is going to affect your business. If the birds are cold and it's miserable out they are not going to grow as well and you're going to have slightly slimmer margins as a result.\n\nI do a couple things to combat this. I make sure the birds are properly hardened off before putting them out, I won't put them out in a thunderstorm, and I make adjustments to their shelters when I know the weather is going to be bad.\n\nIn general the birds don't gain as well in the Spring with it being colder. In the middle of the summer they grow really well with warmer temps. Le sigh.\n\nGot broiler questions?

        "description": "When planning out your brooder for raising chickens on your poultry farm you're going to want to factor in about 1/2 of a square foot per bird. Keep in mind that your feeders and waterers take up space too so make sure it's not too crowded in there.\n\nIn the beginning when the chicks are brand new and really small I give them about half of the total space. This is only for the first 2 days. This allows the chicks to get used to the brooder, not get lost in a corner somewhere and get cold, and keeps them a little warmer if it's chilly outside early in the season. After day 2 I open the brooder to the full space and they do fine.\n\nThe most important activity you can do on farm and especially in the brooder is observation. Taking a little time to sit and watch your plants or animals and see how they are behaving will give you a better understanding as to whether they are happy in their environment.\n\nhttp://farmmarketingsolutions.com",

        "description": "Compost is something that i have been learning more about this year. There is always room to grow as a farmer and always a new skill to try and figure out. Composting has been relatively easy once I had the raw ingredients.\n\nI knew I had to learn it so I learned it. I took action. That's the message of today's video. We're not here to sustain and be sustainable, our goal should be to be regenerative. To take action that adds value back into the earth and works to rebuild soils, forests, pastures, and waterways. If we're sustaining then we're just maintaining. Let's take it one step further.\n\nIt's great that I feel that strongly about just stirring a pile of poo but I really do believe in what I do. Sure it's a lot of work, but the lifestyle is rewarding in ways I never dreamed of. I'm looking forward to spreading this compost in my gardens and in my hop yard this year. With everything I learn and everything I do I get one step closer to achieving my goal of making the world a better place.\n\nJoin me in that goal. We'll have a lot of fun doing it. There will be ups and downs, but at the end of the day wee can reflect, have a drink, and know that today we tried.\n\nHere's a link for too much information on composting:\nhttp://articles.extension.org/pages/18567/making-and-using-compost-for-organic-farming\n\nHere's the thermometer I'm using:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/REOTEMP-FG20P-Backyard-Compost-Thermometer/dp/B002P5RGMI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463654493&sr=8-1&keywords=reotemp+compost+thermometer\n\nHere's me and Scott:\nhttp://farmmarketingsolutions.com",

The Pottinger cultivator with the new points on worked really well and the packer worked well for breaking down the larger clods. Once the crop has been drilled it will then be rolled in with the farms set of rollers, this is to conserve the moisture. In today's video the topic of discussion is spring, the trees and hedgerows have been budding up, the wildlife is flourishing on the farm, with hares, deer, barn owls, robins, sparrows and much more, it's important to take it all in at this time of the year, we operate such busy lives in the western world and it's nice to be able to appreciate the seasons as they come around, Enjoy today's video!\n\nSupport The Channel And Become An Olly's Farm Member -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwRCh8kSqFRHe8pVhbsLlA/join\n\nOlly's Farm Merchandise - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/ollys-farm\n\nFollow Olly's Farm On\n\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/ollys.farm?r=na...\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/OllysFarm1/\n\nTo see Olly's daily antics \n\nSnapchat Search - Olly's Farm",

Overall both attachments are of strong build quality, and both carry out the task of picking up silage bales without damaging the bales which is very important! The Manitou suited the attachments and i'm very pleased with how the day worked out, Enjoy! \n\nSupport The Channel And Become An Olly's Farm Member -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwRCh8kSqFRHe8pVhbsLlA/join\n\nOlly's Farm Merchandise - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/ollys-farm\n\nFollow Olly's Farm On\n\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/ollys.farm?r=na...\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/OllysFarm1/\n\nTo see Olly's daily antics \n\nSnapchat Search - Olly's Farm",

        "description": "Exploring the farms and desert in southern California!  WIth our extra day in Los Angeles, we decided to head to Bakersfield and explore the farming in the area.  We saw oranges, almonds, lettuce, cabbage, romaine, onion, carrots, grapes, potatoes, etc.  It is unbelievably diverse in the San Joaquin area of the central Valley!  After that we headed east to Lancaster and checked out the Kill Bill Church before heading to Santa Clarita for some dinner than on to LAX!\n\nI am a 5th generation family farmer from West-Central Minnesota.  The recent interest in food, combined with a large amount of 'misinformation' has driven me to start this channel.  I hope to be someone people can relate to and trust when they question how their food is grown and raised.  I also hope to become a 'smarter' farmer through my experiences with this channel.  I strongly believe we must have an open mind and a willingness to learn about others, or we cannot move forward as one.  My goal is to build the connection between farmers and consumers by facilitating a collaborative conversation amongst everyone.  I do this by sharing my day-to-day farming experiences, my opinions on certain topics, and occasionally visiting other farms and businesses to help better understand other farming and business practices.  There is no limit to where this channel may go, so please join me!!\n\n\"peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.\"\n-Albert Einstein\n\n► Visit our website\nhttps://www.mnmillennialfarmer.com/\n► Subscribe to our channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MNMillennialFarmer\n► Follow MN Millennial Farmer on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/farmmillennial\n► Follow MN Millennial Farmer on Snapchat \nhttps://www.snapchat.com/add/millennialfarm\n► Follow MN Millennial Farmer on Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/\n► Follow MN Millennial Farmer on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/\n\n\nWatch more Videos like this:\n►WATCH IT NOW: New Years in LA/Rose Parade/AgPhd Salute to Farmers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVLw3h5Apo&t=208s.\n►WATCH IT NOW: Little Farm Kid Drives Big John Deere Tractor!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPEwJ7z8eq8&t=28s\n►WATCH IT NOW: MAJOR combine damage - Nov. 6th Harvest Vlog\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maCohMwAC6k&t=129s",

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.\nWith growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \n\n► Follow Along\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/\nhttps://twitter.com/farmmillennial\n\n► Edited By\nBecky Johnson",
