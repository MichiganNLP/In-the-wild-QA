{"url": "https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=ANPmLohXpNE", "description": "Video footage shows Russian made combat helicopters in action during several miliary training exercises involving close air support filmed from several angles including GoPro cameras. Most helicopters shown in the video are the MIL MI-24 Hind & Kamow KA-52 Alligator.\n\nThe Mil Mi-24 (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u043b\u044c \u041c\u0438-24; NATO reporting name: Hind) is a large helicopter gunship, attack helicopter and low-capacity troop transport with room for eight passengers. It is produced by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and has been operated since 1972 by the Soviet Air Force and its successors, along with 48 other nations.\n\nIn NATO circles, the export versions, Mi-25 and Mi-35, are denoted with a letter suffix as \"Hind D\" and \"Hind E\". Soviet pilots called the Mi-24 the \"flying tank\" (\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a; letayushchiy tank), a term used historically with the famous World War II Soviet Il-2 Shturmovik armored ground attack aircraft. More common unofficial nicknames were \"Galina\" (or \"Galya\"), \"Crocodile\" (\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b; Krokodil), due to the helicopter's camouflage scheme and \"Drinking Glass\" (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d; Stakan), because of the flat glass plates that surround earlier Mi-24 variants' cockpits.\n\nKa-52 Alligator is an all-weather attack helicopter operated by the Russian Air Force. Developed by Kamov Design Bureau (part of Russian Helicopters), Ka-52 is a twin-seat variant of the Ka-50 attack helicopter.\n\nThe Ka-52 helicopter can destroy enemy armoured and unarmoured ground targets, low-speed aerial targets and personnel at the frontline and in tactical depth. It is also deployed as a surveillance platform and aerial command post for a group of attack helicopters.\n\nThe first Ka-52 helicopter was rolled out in December 1996. The helicopter completed its first flight in June 1997. The serial production of Ka-52 began in 2008 at Progress Arsenyev Aviation plant in the Primorye region of Russia.\n\nRussia plans to equip its proposed Mistral Class amphibious assault ships with Ka-52K helicopters. Ka-52K is a naval variant of the Ka-52 Alligator.\n\nCredits: Russian Ministry of Defence:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQGqX5Ndpm4snE0NTjyOJnA\n\nWarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions & facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
