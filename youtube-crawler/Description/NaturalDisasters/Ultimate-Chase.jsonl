Mike was trapped on the island for 2 days before being able to get a ride via boat back to the mainland...."}

I shot this video when I was 21 years old and it was the 4th Hurricane I had documented in my life. I neved left my condo, I just woke up and filmed it out my windows as the storm surge rose. There is an entire missing tape so this video is a bit incomplete but I thought it would still be worth posting online. Its not the most dramatic footage I've shot but still interesting to see....The Hurricane Irene I shot in 2011 in the Bahamas was a huge improvement of video skills and quality..."}

Watch as a \"Lady of Victory Church\" at Plainview gets spared by less than 100 yards. Video shot by Mike Theiss while driving for Cloud 9 Tours. The power of nature up close and personal can be rewarding at times but other times disturbing and sad. While chasing Tornadoes we never wish to see these tornadoes affect peoples homes and lives. We estimate this tornado crossed the road about 200 yards in front of our location. It was hard to keep the camera steady in 80+ mph winds being sucked into the tornado.\n\nWant to see something like this is person with experienced chasers ?

This Hurricane had some of the most intense lightning I've ever witnessed in a Hurricane, you could even see the lightning in the daylight. The dog I rescued was curled up into a ball shaking and terrified in Hurricane force winds and saw me and ran up to the car. She was a very nice dog and the next day when the storm was over I gave her to someone in town and they were going to get her to her owners. Video copyright by Mike Theiss."}
