The fire broke out on Monday afternoon, grew as it was fanned by high winds and low humidity, and by Thursday morning it was 35 percent contained, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said in a statement.\n\nWinds of more than 20 miles per hour picked up embers and carried them across Interstate 10, which runs east-west through Florida, the department said. Portions of the highway were shut down.\n\nAs of early Thursday, about 1,100 people had evacuated their homes in Santa Rosa County. \u201cThat is going to continue through at least today,\u201d said Joe Zwierzchowski, a Florida Forest Service spokesman.\n\nDozens of homes and multiple structures have been lost to the flames, he said, and the county has opened emergency shelters.\n\nMichael Dunlavy, his wife, Haley, and their five sons could see the smoke and flames from five fires several miles from their house in Milton, a city in Santa Rosa County, on Wednesday. Around noon, they received the order to evacuate. \u201cFirst we went outside and looked around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really did not seem like it could reach us, but it was moving pretty fast.\u201d\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/florida-wildfire.html"}

It moved into an \u201cexplosive state\u201d on Friday morning, the National Emergency Management Organization said in a Twitter posting.\n\nThe emergency management agency said that the ash fall had been registered as far as the country\u2019s international airport on the southern part of the island \u2014 more than 12 miles away \u2014  while an ash plume had billowed 20,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVideo clips shot in Chateaubelair, a town on the foothills of the volcano, showed the sky darkened by ash as people wearing face masks trudged through the streets lugging their belongings.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties from the eruption, and the extent of any damage in the surrounding area was unclear.\n\nThe eruption came a day after officials had raised the alert level following several small tremors detected at the volcano, with clouds of steam seen erupting from its peak. The country\u2019s prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, ordered a full evacuation of the area.\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/world/americas/volcano-St-Vincent-eruption-caribbean.html\n\n#LaSoufriere #volcano #eruption"}

More than 9,400 people were being sheltered by the state Saturday, The Associated Press reported, citing Gov. John Bel Edwards. Nearly all of them were Laura evacuees.\n\nThe governor said 3,000 National Guard troops were mobilized after Delta and 10,000 utility workers were fanned out across the region.\n\nWeary residents began to return home and assess the damage in Lake Charles, where Patrick King waded thorugh knee-deep water to get his home after spending Friday night in Beaumont, Texas.\n\n\u201cI was hoping and praying that it didn\u2019t get into the house, but it did. It rose up close to the furniture,\u201d King told the AP.\n\nIn the nearby community of Iowa, Brian Schexnayder\u2019s home was badly damaged by Laura. Friday night, Hurricane Delta brought more misery.\n\n\u201cIn the first five minutes, it blew the tarp off,\u201d Schexnayder, 62, told nola.com.\n\nRain came down into every room.\n\nDelta dumped record amounts of rain in some parts of Louisiana, causing flash flooding that stranded cars, made roads impassable and sent water into homes. More than a foot of rain fell in parts of Lake Charles.\n\n\"I'll take all the thoughts and prayers I can get right now,\" Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter told CNN.\n\nAbout 7,000 residents of Lake Charles had not been able to return to their homes since they were damaged by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago, Hunter said. Across the city, Hurricane Delta on Friday ripped tarps off the damaged buildings as if they were bright blue Band-Aids.\n\nMore than 497,000 customers were without power in Louisiana as of about 4 p.m. CDT Saturday, according to poweroutage.us. Another 87,000 outages were being reported in Texas, and Mississippi had more than 39,000. Thousands in Arkansas and Alabama also had no electricity. At one point Saturday morning, more than 800,000 homes and businesses along the Gulf Coast were without power.\n\nRead more: https://weather.com/news/news/2020-10-10-hurricane-delta-impacts-louisiana-texas-mississippi-alabama"}
