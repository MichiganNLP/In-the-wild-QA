Overall both attachments are of strong build quality, and both carry out the task of picking up silage bales without damaging the bales which is very important! The Manitou suited the attachments and i'm very pleased with how the day worked out, Enjoy! \n\nSupport The Channel And Become An Olly's Farm Member -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwRCh8kSqFRHe8pVhbsLlA/join\n\nOlly's Farm Merchandise - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/ollys-farm\n\nFollow Olly's Farm On\n\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/ollys.farm?r=na...\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/OllysFarm1/\n\nTo see Olly's daily antics \n\nSnapchat Search - Olly's Farm"}

The Pottinger cultivator with the new points on worked really well and the packer worked well for breaking down the larger clods. Once the crop has been drilled it will then be rolled in with the farms set of rollers, this is to conserve the moisture. In today's video the topic of discussion is spring, the trees and hedgerows have been budding up, the wildlife is flourishing on the farm, with hares, deer, barn owls, robins, sparrows and much more, it's important to take it all in at this time of the year, we operate such busy lives in the western world and it's nice to be able to appreciate the seasons as they come around, Enjoy today's video!\n\nSupport The Channel And Become An Olly's Farm Member -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwRCh8kSqFRHe8pVhbsLlA/join\n\nOlly's Farm Merchandise - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/ollys-farm\n\nFollow Olly's Farm On\n\nInstagram - https://instagram.com/ollys.farm?r=na...\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/OllysFarm1/\n\nTo see Olly's daily antics \n\nSnapchat Search - Olly's Farm"}
