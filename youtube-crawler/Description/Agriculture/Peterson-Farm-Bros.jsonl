We are 5th generation family farmers who farm together in Kansas with our parents David and Marla, our sister Laura, and our wives BrookeAnna (Greg's), Riley (Nathan's) and Caelan (Kendal's). This channel is full of videos about our family farm and what we do to take care of animals and grow crops. Our videos range from parodies, to informational videos, to entertainment videos, to our \"Life of a Farmer\" vlogs. It is our hope that these videos will give everyone who watches them a better understanding of what a real farm in the midwest looks like. We try to be as honest and upfront as possible in our videos and our posts and hope that viewers will realize how much hard work goes into farming!
